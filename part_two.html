<p>The entire next day was basically planning two weddings. The king and queen sat both couples down to figure out what each of them wanted in their weddings. Honestly, it was chaos. At some point, both couples ended up leaving because they were tired of it. Letting the king and queen do whatever they want, the two couples ended up changing into casual clothing and heading into the kingdom, without the escorts and all of that fancy stuff. Trying to blend in.<br><br>

They ran from street to street, as fast as they could. The four of them stop, gasping for breath in a village, a couple kilometres away from the palace. <br><br>

“I’ve never had so much fun running away in my life. And I’ve once tried to escape on one of the wagons that transport the food into our palace.” Emerson says. <br><br>

“Hey, wait! This is the village that my father lives in.” Scarlet tells us. <br><br>

“Come on!” she calls, taking off down one of the roads.<br><br>

The rest of us follow after her, trying to keep up to her pace. We eventually stopped at a large blacksmith shop that looked like it could’ve been around for centuries. <br><br>

“This shop has been in our family for generations. My father and I have kept it running for generations. Hopefully my brother will be coming back from his post soon, so he can help father run the shop without me.” <br><br>

“Who’s your brother?” Olivia asks her.<br><br>

“Aiden Cyprus.”<br><br>

“I’ll see what I can do.”<br><br>

“Thank you, Olivia.”<br><br>

“Come in. I’m sure my father would love to meet you all.” Scarlet says, entering the shop.<br><br>

The three of them exchange a glance, then head in as well.<br><br>

Olivia walks around the room, admiring the amount of work that her family has put into the shop.<br><br>

Everything looks brand new, but keeping with the rustic look of the place. There are weapons of all types hanging on the wall. Suits of armour on stands. Everything that you could ever think of. It was truly impressive. <br><br>

“Father! I brought some guests.” Scarlet calls.<br><br>

A man with a short black beard, messy black curls and a slightly aged face walks out from the back of the shop. <br><br>

“Ah, Scarlet, honey, give your old man a hug.” the man responds, engulfing Scarlet in a bear hug.<br><br><br><br>

“Who are your guests?” he asks her.<br><br>

She steps aside to reveal the three of us.<br><br>

“Y-your majesties. I didn’t realise that you would be coming today. P-please, have a look around.” he stutters, shocked by their presence.<br><br>

“Please, none of that. Today, we wish to only explore. No royal duties for today.” Olivia responds, and the man looks slightly relieved. <br><br>

“Can I get you guys anything to drink? I’m sure that I have some tea in the back.”<br><br>

“No thank you. We’re fine for now.”<br><br>

“Of course.”<br><br>



After about half an hour of staying at the shop, the four of them left, deciding to explore a little bit more.<br><br>

“Scarlet, you’re the expert here. Can you show us around? Show us what it’s like to be a normal person?” Miles asks her.<br><br>

“Of course, your majesty. I can teach you how normal people live.” Scarlet chuckles.<br><br>

The entire rest of the day was pretty much Scarlet showing the royals what life was like outside of the palace. They ate some meat from a stand off of the street, Scarlet promising that it was really tasty, which it was. They explored a school, and even read to the children there. They never knew that life outside of the palace was so interesting. <br><br>

“Well, as much as I hate to leave, we better be heading back now. Your parents might start to worry that someone kidnapped you three.” Scarlet tells them, earning them all to let out a small laugh. <br><br>

The four of them slowly make their way back to the palace, reminiscing about the events of the day.<br><br>

“Do you remember when Miles tripped simply walking down the street?” Olivia asks, earning a laugh from Emerson and Scarlet, while Miles simply glared at her.<br><br>

“Hey! You were the one who spilled your drink because of a wasp.” Miles retorts.<br><br>

“You should’ve seen the size of that thing! It was huge!”<br><br>

Miles rolls her eyes at her, and they make their way into the castle. <br><br>

“Where were you four! We were worried sick!” Queen Fiona shouts as soon as they enter.<br><br>

“Relax, mother. We were just exploring the kingdom.”<br><br>

“Very well, but the next time you do that, at least tell someone in the palace so we don’t have the servants scurrying around the place, looking for you.”<br>
    <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>

<p>
The next day, Olivia returned to her investigation duties, and Miles returned to training the guards. <br><br>

Olivia wore her usual black outfit, and met up with the scholars.<br><br>

“Did you guys find anything?” she asks them.<br><br>

“Yes. After investigation, we found out that the knife that killed your brother was from the kitchens. We studied the knife, and found out that it was coated in moonshadow poison. After careful inspection of the blood sample from General Carlos, General Adrien, and the knife, we found out that it was the same batch of poison in each person. That means that this person has a giant tub of this poison lying around and is storing it somewhere in the palace. I would like you to ask your father if we can have a full inspection of the kitchens, and interrogate every staff member in the kitchens. We need to get to the bottom of this before anyone else gets hurt.” Mia explains. <br><br>

“Of course. I will tell my father the second after we finish today. Is there anything else that I need to know, or can we take a look around the kitchen now, before we get experts in there?”<br><br>

“Let’s head inside.”<br><br>

The six scholars and Olivia headed down to the kitchens to see what they could find. Sadly, they couldn’t find anything without violating rules that her father put in place.The only way that they could find out more was if he let them. Which Olivia was planning to talk to him about as soon as possible. <br><br>

After they were done for the day, Olivia immediately headed for her father’s study. She knocked on the door and waited until her father let her in.<br><br>

“What can I help you with?” he asks her.<br><br>

“I wish to ask you for permission to have a thorough investigation of the kitchens, and for a proper interrogation of all of the kitchen staff. The scholars have found out that the knife that killed Donovan came from the kitchens. They also found a bottle of moonshadow poison there when General Carlos was killed. I also wish to look through the records for the poison, to see exactly what was done with it in the last three months, to see who would have it in our kingdom.”<br><br>

“Very well. I’ll tell the search team to investigate the kitchens and the houses of all of the kitchen staff. You may interrogate them at 3:00pm tomorrow. I will make sure that they are all there.”<br><br>

“Thank you, father.” she says, exiting the room. <br><br>

Letting her team rest for the day, Olivia searches for Scarlet, knowing that she wouldn’t be hanging out with Miles since he’s training all day.<br><br>

“Hey, Scarlet.”<br><br>

“Oh, hey Olivia. By the way, there’s no reason for you to call me Scarlet all the time. Call me Scar if you want.”<br><br>

“Very well, Scar. You can call me Liv as well, if you want.”

“Sure thing”<br><br>

“Want to hang out?”<br><br>

“Sure. What do you have in mind?”<br><br>

“I don’t know. All I know is that I need to get away from boys for a little while.”<br><br>

“Me too.” Scarlet chuckles. <br><br>

The two of them end up going to Olivia’s salon, doing each other’s make-up and nails. <br><br>

“You know, I’ve never had anyone to do this with. Usually my maids do this, and that isn’t much fun.” Olivia says.<br><br>

“Same here. Not the whole maid thing, but it’s boring doing this by yourself. I’m glad that you’re doing this with me. And it’s good to get away from the boys for a while.” Scarlet responds. <br><br>


“True.”<br><br>

“So, I have to ask. I know that you and Emerson are engaged and all, but Miles told me that it was an arranged marriage. Do you actually love him?”<br><br>

“Honestly, I’m not sure. Our fathers have been friends for a long time, even while the war was going on. He was my first friend, mainly because our fathers would always make us hang out together. We both knew since we were fifteen that we would have to marry each other some day, but at the time, we didn’t really want that. I wanted to actually find love, and Emerson was tired of being controlled by his parents all of the time, and the news didn’t help with that. I feel like after a little while, he eventually got used to the fact that we would have to marry each other, but didn’t realise that it would be so soon. Thank my brother Jake for making that happen. I feel like I could get to love him through marriage, but I’m not sure. It’s only been two days since we got engaged. Before that, we were simply friends. It’s not like things are going to drastically change in two days. But who knows, right?”<br><br>

“I guess.”<br><br>

“Why do you ask?”<br><br>

“I just figured since you were so close, that you at least felt something towards him.”<br><br>


“Can we talk about something else?”<br><br>

“Like what?”<br><br>

“I don’t know. How ‘bout when I saw you kissing my brother the day of the ball.”<br><br>

“Y-you saw that?” she stammers, blushing.<br><br>

“Yup.”<br>
<p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>

The rest of the day was the two of them talking and enjoying each other’s company. <br><br>

Once Scarlet left, Olivia pondered about what Scarlet had told her. <br><br>

<em>Did she really feel something more towards Emerson? She shook her head. No, no. I can’t. He’s my best friend. That would be weird. Then again, they were engaged, so how much weirder can things get?</em><br><br>

The entire night she thought about that one question. Did she feel anything more towards Emerson, other than being friends? At some point during the night, she realised that she did. She always knew that she felt something more towards him, but she made herself think that it was only because he’s her best friend. Now, there was no way that she could deny it. She’d inadvertently fallen for her best friend. She mentally cursed herself for that, but realised that he could possibly feel the same. Then her mind started spinning about whether he felt the same or not. She eventually realised that it was a lost cause to try to figure it out at 2 o’clock in the morning, and just decided to get some sleep. 
<p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>

<p>During the course of the next two weeks, Olivia made huge progress on the investigation. The staff found a page in the kitchens that looked a lot like a hitlist. On the list were all the people that were already killed, along with a few more. While reading it, Olivia was determined to stop the murderer before the others were killed as well. She interrogated all of the kitchen staff, and three people stuck out as possible suspects of the murders. She had the king keep them locked up for the time being, until they found any more evidence that one of them could be the murderer.<br><br>

Jake finally told the kingdom about all of the murders, and thankfully, they didn’t take it the wrong way. With the engagements and everything, they made it look like they had everything under control. <br><br>

One day, Olivia is walking down a hall towards the library when she hears some commotion. She runs as fast as she can in her heels to find General Morgan lying in the middle of the hall, knife in his chest, blood pooling around him. <br><br>

“Oh my god! What happened!” she shouts, running over to him. <br><br>

“Th-the m-murderer said, ‘I’m from Ilra-’” General Morgan whispers, then his eyes glaze over and he’s gone. <br><br>
Olivia replays his last words, and realises what he meant. The murderer is from Ilratheino. <br><br>

“Guard!” she shouts, and they come rushing towards her, shocked at the sight.<br><br>

“Move the body. Take the knife to the scholars and tell them to run tests on the knife. Prepare the body for a burial and gather the members of council immediately. There needs to be a meeting now!” she commands in a voice that sounded so much like her mother when she’s really angry. <br><br>

She’s walking back to her room to get changed, since her dress is covered in blood when she runs into the one person that she really doesn’t want to see right now.<br><br>

“Liv! What happened! Why are you covered in blood?” Emerson shouts, rushing towards her.<br><br>

“Get away from me.” she growls, pushing past him, but he grabs her wrist, spinning her around to face her.<br><br>

“Liv? What happened? Why are you like this?”<br><br>

“Why am I like this!” she screams. “Let’s see! How ‘bout the fact that the murderer that killed my brother is from Ilratheino! You knew about this the entire time and you didn’t even bother to tell me! You just let me think that you had nothing to do with this entire situation but in reality, you are the reason for all of this! I trusted you! You knew who killed my brother, but you stayed quiet! Stay away from me if you know what’s best for you.” she warns, ripping her wrist out of his grapes, and walking away.<br><br>

“I didn’t know about that! I swear!” He calls after her, but it’s too late. She was gone. <br><br>

She quickly changes and heads to the council chambers. <br><br>

“Why have you gathered us here, Olivia?” her father asks her as she walks in. Everyone is looking at her, concerned. <br><br>

“Because the murderer is from Ilratheino.” she says and everyone gasps in shock. <br><br>

“Are you sure about that?”<br><br>

“Positive. General Morgan was just killed, and his last words were “The murderer said ‘I’m from Ilratheino.’” We have the Whitlock family here, and they know who the murderer is. My suggestion is to interrogate them.”<br><br>

“How do you know that they’ll tell us the truth? If they really do know who the murderer is, why would they just tell us that?”<br><br>

“Because I have just the thing that will make them tell us.”<br>
    <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>

<p>The next day, the entire Whitlock family is tied up to chairs in the dungeons, the Ambrose family glaring daggers at all of them.<br><br>

“Liv, please listen to me. We don’t have any idea who the murderer is.” Emerson begs.<br><br>

“I don’t want to listen to your feeble excuses. Addam, potion please.” Olivia says, and Addam hands her a small glass phial containing a clear water like liquid.<br><br>

“This is something that my late brother gave to me before he died. It makes whoever takes it tell the truth. Five drops of this and I can have you telling me your entire life story.” Olivia explains, scaring Emerson half to death. <br><br>

The scholars pour two drops of the potion into each member of the Whitlock family, glaring daggers at them the entire time. <br><br>

“What do you know about the murderer in our palace?” King Darius commands.<br><br>

“My father told me before he died that he sent someone into your kingdom at the beginning of the war to bring your kingdom to your knees if we ever lost to you in the war. He commanded him to kill General Carlos, General Morgan, General Adrien, Prince Donovan, You, the rest of your children, and the rest of the generals.” King Felix responds, then clamps a mouth over his hand at the information that he just spilled. <br><br>

“Emerson, did you really not know anything about this?” Olivia asks him, voice softer than before.<br><br>

“No. I promise I didn’t know anything about this. If I did, I would’ve told you. I love you too much to do that to you.” Emerson responds sincerely. <br><br>

Olivia is taken aback by his response.<br><br>

    <em>Did he seriously just say that he loved me?</em><br><br>

Not trusting her mouth to speak, she simply nods her thanks, still pondering over what he had just said. <br><br>


At the end of the interrogation, Olivia has a better idea of who the murderer is. She asks her father if she can interrogate the prisoners again, and he gladly complies. The Ambrose family releases the Whitlock family, then exits the dungeons.<br><br>

As she makes her way towards her room, a hand grabs her wrist. She turns around to see Emerson looking at her with a pleading look on his face.<br><br>

“What’s up?” <br><br>

“Are you still mad at me?” he asks her.<br><br>

“Not anymore, now that I know that you had nothing to do with it.” Olivia responds, and Emerson lets out a sigh of relief. <br><br>

“I really did mean what I said back there.”<br><br>

“What do you mean?”<br><br>

“I love you. And I know that it’s weird since we’ve been friends since we were twelve, but I really do love you. You don’t have to love me back at all or anything, and I know that it’s really weird timing at that, given the whole murderer thing going on, bu-”<br><br>

Olivia interrupts his ranting by kissing him. <br><br>

“I love you too. And by the way, you talk too much.” She tells him, pulling away.<br>
     <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>

<p>Over the course of the next few days, Olivia and Miles end up convincing Scarlet and Emerson to help them. Miles trains everyone in the barracks for the morning, then all of them will help Olivia with the investigation itself. <br><br>

Currently, Miles is sparring Olivia, and Emerson is sparring Scarlet. Each pair spars until one person can place their sword beside the other’s throat. Emerson beat Scarlet because he’s more experienced in fighting, and surprisingly, Olivia managed to beat Miles. <br><br>

“You’ve gotten better, Liv.” Miles tells her.<br><br>

“Thanks. By the way, you are really predictable when you spar, you know that?”<br><br>

“Sadly, yes. In my defence, I just go with what I know. Not trying to do some stupid move that I don’t normally do that could get me killed.” <br><br>

“Fair.” she shrugs.<br><br>

“Okay, I’m sparring with your fiancé next.” Miles says.<br><br>

“Don’t kill him, please.”<br><br>

“Why do you care all of a sudden? Do you like him or something?” Miles taunts, making Olivia blush slightly.<br><br>

“You do!” he gasps, taking in her blushing face.<br><br>

“Go spar with my fiancé, will you?” she responds, shoving him towards Emerson.<br><br>

“We’re continuing this conversation later.” he tells her, then goes to spar with Emerson. <br><br>

Olivia and Scarlet spar, and Olivia is surprised by Scarlet's abilities. <br><br>

“Where did you learn to spar so well?” she asks her.<br><br>

“My father thought it would be a good skill to learn. He also did it because we had all of the equipment.” Scarlet shrugs. <br><br>

“That’s nice of him.”<br>
    <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>

<p>With all of the training that Miles has gotten Emerson, Olivia, and Scarlet to do, they’re in their best shape. Guaranteed, when they see the person that has been killing everybody, they will be ready. Also, with Miles, Scarlet and Emerson helping with the investigation, they’re further along than Olivia would’ve ever thought. <br><br>

Olivia had interrogated the three people that seemed the most suspicious, but she still didn’t get anymore leads on who exactly the murderer was. <br>
    <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>

<p>One day, the four of them are walking out of the training grounds when one of the scholars that Olivia had sent to investigate while she was training came running up to them.<br><br>

“Liv! Liv! Emergency! Emergency!” she shouts, gasping for breath.<br><br>

“Hey! Hey! Mia, calm down. What’s going on?” Olivia asks her.<br><br>

“One of the prisoners has escaped!” Mia tells her.<br><br>
Olivia’s eyes widened, and despite running 15km that morning, she bolted towards the palace, the rest of them chasing after her. She threw open the palace doors and raced to the throne room.<br><br>

“What happened?” she demanded.<br><br>

“One of the prisoners escaped. We have a suspicion that they’re the murderer. I want you, Emerson, Miles, Scarlet, and the guard to search for the prisoner. Check every square inch of this kingdom, and don’t rest until you find him.” her father demanded.<br><br>

“Yes father.”<br><br>

She exited the throne room, and the three of them were waiting for her.<br><br>

“Miles, gather the best men of the guard that you can find and have them ready for a very long mission. Scarlet, can you see if your father would be able to lend yourself and Emerson some armour and weapons please. The four of us are going on a scavenger hunt.”<br>
    <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>

<p>The next four hours were the four of them getting everything they needed to head out the next day. Scarlet’s father had provided her and Emerson with all the gear that they would need. Miles had gathered a group of twelve men, deeming that they are the best men in the kingdom. Olivia had also gathered a couple of scholars to help the group track down the missing prisoner.<br> <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p></p>

<p>The next day, the four of them met at the gates at the first rays of sunlight. Miles left his top general in charge, and sent orders for the guard to surround the kingdom, not letting anyone in or out. The scholars and the guardsmen are waiting for them just on the other side of the gates. <br><br>

“You guys ready to go?” Miles asks them.<br><br>

“Absolutely.”<br><br>

They meet up with the others, and they head out. The guardsmen are pulling a large wagon filled with armour and weapons with horses. Miles, Olivia, Scarlet, and Emerson are riding in front of the wagon, riding horseback. Olivia is riding a midnight black horse with green eyes, and Miles is riding a dark grey horse with stormy grey eyes, both horses given to the twins by their parents on their eighteenth birthday. Emerson is riding a pearl white horse with a jet black main, and sky blue eyes. And Scarlet is riding a caramel brown horse with a dark brown main and charcoal black eyes given to her by her father. <br><br>

The scholars are riding in the front, looking to see if they can pick up the prisoner’s trail. <br><br>

After a few minutes of riding, the scholars are finally able to pick up the prisoner’s trail. The group rides as fast as they can in the direction of the trail. They rode for many hours, only stopping for food and water. The trail abruptly ended in the centre of a village not so far away from Scarlet’s home village. <br><br>

Everyone gets off of their horses and spreads out to try and recover their trail. After about half an hour with little to no avail, the team regrouped in the centre of the village, at the crossroad between a park, a school, a church, and a row of houses. <br><br>

“How can this happen?” Emerson asks. “People can’t just disappear, can they?”<br><br>

“Not that I know of. Then again, some strange things have been happening ever since the war ended, so I wouldn’t be surprised if there was such a thing as magic now.” Olivia commented. <br><br>

“We have to keep going. We need to find that prisoner before he hurts anyone else.” Miles tells us.<br><br>

“You mean me?” A deep voice calls, standing in the middle of the park. Behind him are a group of about two dozen people, all of them with weapons in hand.<br><br>

The group reacting as quickly as possible grabs their weapons, and hastily throws on their armour. The only people not bothering to put some on are Miles, Olivia, Emerson, and Scarlet. All they grab is their weapon of choice. For Miles, it is a hand and a half sword fixed with obsidian and gold accents on the hilt. For Olivia it is a two handed sword with sapphires and silver accents on the hilt. The twins’ swords matching their house colours. Emerson carries a pistol in a pouch on his belt and a very long sword with pearls and emerald on the hilt falls over his left hip. Scarlet pulled out a long one handed sword with garnets and rubies on the hilt. Pretty much everyone in the group fought with swords, except for the scholars. They pretty much just backed into the streets, not wanting to get in the way, since they have little to no fighting experience. <br><br>

The one disadvantage that the group has over the prisoner’s other than numbers, is that the prisoner’s group has a variety of weapons ranging from maces, to spiked balls on chains. <br><br>

The guardsmen tossed everyone a shield, which they all caught with ease, and they walked up to the other group. <br><br>

“Who are you?” Miles demanded that fit the crowned prince nicely.<br><br>

“My name is Demetri Valdarus, and I am here for revenge. You killed my entire family during the war. My parents, my wife, and even my children were murdered at the hands of you and your father. Before the late King Gabriel Whitlock died, he sent me on a mission. He knew that he was leaving this world soon, and since he knew that his son would side with your kingdom because your king was his best friend, he knew that he needed me to infiltrate your palace. He told me that once Ilratheino fell into your hands, that’s when I should start. Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. Your king is a little too soft-hearted, I’ll say. He let me in, and after that, it was easy to plot my revenge. I’d start with your father’s right-hand man, then carry on further up the ranks until I got to you and your father. I was planning on killing the other brother, but he was always with someone. Thankfully I managed to kill the other one though. That girl over there,” He gestured to Olivia. “Almost screwed up my plans though. I’d been hiding in his room for the past hour when he was doing some research, and I was about to attack when she decided to walk in. Thankfully she left, and I could continue. I have to admit, it was easier to kill him that I thought it would. Didn’t even put up a fight.”<br><br>

With those words, Miles and Olivia had it. It was painful enough to hear that this man wanted everyone in their family dead, but to explain exactly how he had managed to kill their brother struck their last nerve. The two of them attacked simultaneously, slashing at the man’s throat. He had just barely managed to dodge the blow, stumbling back into the group that he’d gathered. <br><br>

With the twins striking first, the battle commenced. <br><br>

The two groups charged at each other, battlecries ringing throughout the village. The guardsmen had the advantage of skill in this one, being trained 24/7 by Miles. The scholars were still watching from the sidelines, knowing that they would be of no use in this situation. The twins were caught in the middle of about half a dozen people attacking them, one of them being the escaped prisoner. Scarlet was doing pretty well, because of being the daughter of a blacksmith, and Emerson was holding his own against a group of attackers. Olivia had many minor cuts along her legs and her arms, and Miles had a slice at his ribs, both due to them not wearing any armour, but they didn’t care. All that mattered was ending this battle, and either killing the prisoner, or capturing him and bringing him back to the palace.<br><br>

Olivia is fighting three people at a time, not knowing how she’s still alive. The three attackers aren’t using swords unfortunately. One of them is swinging a spiked ball on a large wooden stick, another is using an axe, and the other is using a spear. She swept the legs of the person with the axe and dealt a deadly blow to his throat. She blocked a jab at her chest from the spear with her shield, then decapitated the person. And finally, she managed to somehow kick the spiked ball out of the last person’s hand, and stabbed him through his heart. <br><br>

Unfortunately, while she was pulling her sword out of the man’s chest, one of the attackers that had slipped by her brother landed a deep wound to her right hip. Olivia cried out in pain, but made sure that no tears followed it. The man went in for another blow, but he parried the blow and impaled his heart.  Despite not being able to press weight on her right leg, she managed to kill a couple more enemies. Sadly, in the process, because of her injury, she managed to get a deep gash extending from her left shoulder blade to her wrist, and another from the middle of her left thigh, trailing down her leg to the bottom of her ankle. <br><br>

Olivia was able to ignore her injuries because of the adrenaline flowing through her, and lunged at the escaped prisoner. Miles helped her out, the two of them attacking as perfectly in sync as before. They managed to pin him to the ground, and Miles tied ropes around his wrists and his ankles, preventing him from escaping again. <br><br>

Olivia was once again swept into battle, the attackers fighting even harder because of their leader being defeated. <br><br>

Thankfully for her, the battle ended shortly after, the majority of the enemies slain on the grass, or surrendered and the guards are tying them up with ropes in the wagon. <br><br>

“Oh my god! Olivia! Are you okay!” Emerson panics, taking in her bleeded appearance. <br><br>

Olivia is currently sitting on the grass, leaning against one of the trees bordering the park. She’s bleeding from her arm, leg, hip, practically every single cut she has. Emerson rushed over to her, fingers death gripping a roll of bandages. He kneels beside her, instantly starting to bandage her up. She winces at the pain when he tightens the bandage around her hip.<br><br>

“Are you okay? It looks like you lost a lot of blood.” Emerson asks her.<br><br>

“Emerson, I got stabbed through the hip, slashed on my arm and leg and lost about five litres of blood, and you’re asking me if I’m okay? I feel like I’m about to pass out right now. Can we just finish rounding up the attackers and get back to the palace please?” Olivia pleads, shakily getting to her feet. She tries to take a few steps forward, but collapses, not being able to put weight on either of her legs. Emerson manages to catch her before she hits the ground, and picks her up bridal style, heading towards Miles and Scarlet.<br><br>

“Liv! Are you alright?” Miles shouts when Emerson approaches.<br><br>

“Will everyone please stop asking me that!” Olivia grumbles.<br><br>

Emerson sits her onto one of the benches on the second wagon that the group brought, the first being used to hold the prisoners. <br><br>

“Emerson, I can ride.” Olivia tells her. <br><br>

“Are you sure? Your legs are seriously injured.” Emerson points out.<br><br>

“Positive. Just hook me up and I can ride back to the palace.”<br><br>

Emerson sighs, and picks up Olivia again, placing her on the back of her horse, and strapping her in. She winces slightly when he did up the buckle on her left leg, but brushed it off. He asked her one more time if she would be able to ride, and she insisted that she would be alright. <br><br>

Everyone else mounted their horses, then they started to move. <br><br>

Olivia grabbed the reins of her horse, and followed along, riding beside Emerson, Miles and Scarlet leading the group back to the palace. <br><br>

As the group rode through the kingdom, clapping and cheering echoed through the people, celebrating the defeat of the murderer. <br><br>

The group finally reached the palace, having to go slower than before because of all of the injuries that people have suffered. <br><br>

Emerson helped Olivia off of her horse, and she placed about 95% of her weight on his shoulders, doing her best to actually walk. <br><br>

“Oh, my god. Olvia, what happened to you! ” her mother cried as soon as she and the king emerged from the palace entrance.<br><br>

Too focused on staying upright, she stayed silent, but Emerson answered for her. <br><br>

“We encountered the prisoner in a village not too far away from where Scarlet’s father lives. He had a group of about two dozen men with him, and a fight broke out. We all suffered various injuries, but Olivia definitely got the worst of it. She has a deep gash running from her left shoulder blade down to her wrist, and another from her left hip to the bottom of her ankle. Despite her injuries, she was able to capture the prisoner in the heat of the battle with great aid by Miles as well. The prisoner and all of the attackers that surrendered are currently in the wagons.” Emerson explains, and the king and queen look stunned. <br><br>

“Take the prisoners to the dungeons.” Miles tells the guardsmen, and the group enters the palace. <br><br>

Instead of going to the large throne room, the king and queen lead the group to a large sitting room, a few couches surrounding a large wooden coffee table, pillows piles onto the ends of the couches. <br><br>

Emerson helps Olivia to one of the couches, then takes a seat beside her. Miles and Scarlet take a seat on a separate couch, and the king and queen sit on the last couch. <br><br>

The king is talking to Miles and Scarlet, about something that Olivia couldn’t make out. Olivia looks like she’s about to pass out, and Emerson gets one of the servants to fetch her a glass of water. She brings the glass to her lips, and tries to concentrate on what her father is saying. <br><br>

“-you’re sure that no one in the group that you fought escaped during the battle?” King Darius asks his son. <br><br>

“I’m positive, father. Even though they overpowered us in numbers, we had the advantage of skill. We made sure that we involved each person into the battle, and if they tried to escape, they would be killed. All of the attackers have either surrendered, or have been killed.”<br><br>

“Very good.”<br><br>

“Olivia, dear? Are you sure you’re going to be alright?” Queen Fiona asks her, concern drawn all over her face.<br><br>

“I’m fine, mother.” Olivia whispers, still feeling a little lightheaded. <br><br>

Once the guardsmen were done bringing the prisoners to the dungeons, they entered the room, standing in line at the back of the room in total silence.  <br><br>

“Thank you, all for your help in capturing the escaped prisoner. You may go back to the barracks now and get some rest. You must be exhausted.” The king tells the guardsmen, and they give him a thankful look and head back to the barracks. <br><br>

Over the next half hour, the four of them informed the king and queen about everything that happened while they were on their journey. Eventually, the king called the meeting, seeing that his daughter looked as pale as a ghost. She was taken to the hospital wing right away, being treated for her injuries, thankful that they weren’t infected. Emerson stayed by her side the entire time, refusing to leave.<br>

</p>

<p>The next morning, Olivia was still in the hospital, not being permitted to leave, to give her injuries a bit more time to heal. <br><br>

She turned her head to see Emerson sitting on a plush couch beside the hospital bed. <br><br>

“How long have you been there?” she asked him groggily. <br><br>

“The whole night,” he answered calmly.<br><br>

“You didn’t have to do that.” <br><br>

“I know, but I wanted to. I needed to make sure you were alright. You practically collapsed in my arms when we left the meeting with your parents. Needed to make sure that you weren’t going to die on me.” he told her.<br><br>

“You know that I wouldn’t do that to you. You can’t get rid of me that easily.” Olivia jokes, earning an eye roll from Emerson.<br><br>

“How are you doing with the injuries?”<br><br>

She slowly sits up, wincing at all of the stitches that the doctors gave her.<br><br>

“As good as anyone with this many injuries. How’s Miles and Scarlet doing?”<br><br>

“They’re okay. They came in a few times to check on you. Your parents came in a couple times as well.” Emerson states.<br><br>

“Has the doctor permitted me to leave yet?”<br><br>

“Yeah, just take it easy, okay? She gave me a bunch of painkillers if you need them as well.”<br><br>

“Thanks, Em. Now can you help me up, please?” <br><br>

Emerson helps Olivia get out of the hospital bed, letting her place her weight on him as they walk out of the hospital wing.<br><br>

Olivia ducked into her room quickly to change out of the dirty clothes that she wore the other day into something more princess-like. It was nothing like the usual gowns that she wore, due to her injuries, but she still looked royal nonetheless. She changed into a white sundress with gold accents on the dress. She slipped on some pastel coloured wedges, saving her feet from walking in heels for the day. <br><br>

Emerson helped her walk down to the same room that they were in the day before, the rest already being there.<br><br>

“Olivia, Emerson, I’m glad that you could finally make it. How are you doing, Olivia? I heard that you had sustained many injuries during your battle.” Queen Fiona says.<br><br>

“I’m okay, thank you for asking.”<br><br>

The two of them sit on the same couch as before, waiting for the meeting to commence.<br><br>

“Now that everyone is here, we need to talk about what to do with the prisoner.” King Darius states. “King Felix, Queen Fiona, since he’s from your kingdom, we give you a choice on what we do with him. Either we execute him in front of the entire kingdom, or you can take him back to Ilratheino and serve his punishment there.”<br><br>

“That is very kind of you, King Darius, but we feel like, since he did so much damage to your family and your kingdom, you have the right to do whatever you want with him.”<br><br>

“Thank you, your majesties. Now, we should probably inform the council about our decision.”<br><br>

And so, both royal families exited the lounge, and entered the council chambers. <br><br>

“Your highness, not to be rude or anything, but why is the Whitlock family joining us this morning?” one of the generals asks the king.<br><br>

“Because they are our honoured guests, and you will treat them with respect.” King Darius scolds, taking his place at the head of the table.<br><br>

“Now, the Whitlock family and mine have come to a conclusion about what will happen to the prisoner, but first, Miles, Olivia, Scarlet, Emerson, would you be willing to tell the council what happened while you were gone, please?” the king asks. <br><br>

The four of them share a glance, and they all signal for Olivia to recall everything that conspired that day. <br><br>

Olivia took a deep breath, and before she got to speak, the same person that asked why the Whitlock family was joining them, interrupted her.<br><br>

“What? No big, fancy gown this time?” he snickered. <br><br>

“Get out!” the king shouts, but the general stays put.<br><br>

“Guards!”<br><br>

And so, three guards carried the general out of the chamber, kicking and screaming. <br><br>

“I’m sorry about that, Olivia. Please continue.” the king tells her.<br><br>

“Well, the four of us, some scholars and a dozen guardsmen rode out of the palace yesterday morning. The scholars and I were able to find the prisoner’s trail pretty quickly and followed it to a village a few kilometres away from the palace. When we got there, the prisoner and a group of about two dozen men were waiting for us in a large park in the centre of the village. For no apparent reason, the prisoner told us the reason why he killed all of the people in the palace. He told us that the reason he did it was because the late king, Gabriel Whitlock sent him to the palace to take us down when Ilratheino fell. He told him to kill as many people as possible, killing the royal family last. Then, we went into battle. We killed the majority of the army that he’d rallied, and the rest are currently being detained in the dungeons at the moment. All that awaits now is what we do with the prisoner.”<br><br>

“Thank you, Olivia. As I said as I walked in, the Whitlock family and mine have decided what we are going to do with the prisoner. He will be executed, and we will broadcast it to the entire kingdom. Let them know that the danger is gone and everything can go back to normal.”<br>

</p>

<p>The next day, the royal family was trying to figure out how exactly they’re going to tell the public about the execution. <br><br>

They had the servants clean up the arena for this, since the Kingdom of Eslarthia had a very strange way of doing executions. They would throw the person into the arena, and around three to five people from the kingdom would enter as well, and they would kill him right then and there. Like I said, strange. <br><br>

The royal family still needed to figure out who would be the executioners. They’d agreed that one of them would be Miles, but the other four are currently undecided.<br><br>

“Can I do it?” Olivia asks.<br><br>

“Liv, there’s no way that I’m letting you in there. You’re still healing from your last battle.” Emerson tells her.<br><br>

“Em, I’m fine and you know that. I’ve been training, and my leg and hip feel fine. Also, I want to avenge my brother. I was in the same room as him when the murderer was in there and I just left him there. Left him alone to fend for himself when he didn’t even know that the danger was there. Please, let me do this.” she begged.<br><br>

The king and queen shared a glance, then the king sighed. <br><br>

“Fine, you can fight. Actually, why don’t you, Miles, Emerson, Scarlet, and Jake be the executioners?” the king asks her.<br><br>

“Sure.”<br>

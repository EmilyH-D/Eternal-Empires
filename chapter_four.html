<h1>Chapter Four</h1>

    <p>The next morning, everyone was tired, sad, and on edge. Every little thing ticked them off. For the king, if a servant had accidentally been late in getting him a drink, instead of ignoring it like usual, he snapped at them, sending the servant running away to fetch another one. For Olivia, if a maid had pulled on her hair too tight, she would snap at them, and send all of the maids out of her room and tell them that she could do it herself. Miles was training until he would drop in the barracks, needing to take his anger out on something. And Jake was constantly running through the events of the kingdom, trying to preoccupy himself with anything that could take his mind off of Donovan.<br><br> 

Olivia wasn’t in the mood to investigate the case today. She left the investigating to the scholars, trusting them not to screw things up. She told them to find as much out about Donovan’s death as possible, and to figure out who the fingerprint on the knife belonged to. <br><br>

After breakfast, she changed into her training outfit, and joined Miles to the barracks. <br><br>

“So, why is my little sister training today? Why aren’t you investigating right now?” Miles asked her, playfully shoving her shoulder. <br><br>

“I’m younger than you by two minutes.” she retorts, rolling her eyes at him.<br><br>

“Still older though. Now seriously, answer the question.”<br><br>

“I don’t feel like it. Not after……… you know……… Why do you ask? Do you not want me to join you?”<br><br>

“Of course not! You’re always welcome to train with me. I only asked because it’s not like you. And I get it. I know how much he meant to you. He meant a lot to me too. I know that it’s way too early to say this to you know, but you can’t grieve about him forever. The kingdom needs you now more than ever to figure out who is behind this case. And besides, he wouldn’t want you to either. He would want you to celebrate life with everything you have. Not be stuck in the past, thinking about what you could do differently.” Miles says.<br><br>

“Thanks, Miles. Now, come on. I’ll race you there!” Olivia shouts, bolting towards the barracks. <br><br>

Miles rolls his eyes and chases after her. <br><br>

They make it to the barracks, doubled over, trying to catch their breath. <br><br>

“How are you so fast?” Miles asks her, gasping for air.<br><br>

“Training. Now, come on. We’re here, aren’t we? Let’s get started.”<br>

    <p>Back in the palace, Jake is doing everything he can to get his mind off of Donovan. <br><br>

Currently, he’s in a meeting with his father and the generals of the kingdom, trying to figure out how to tell the public. All they know right now about all of this is that the prince is dead. They don’t know how he died at all, nor do they know about General Carlos being murdered either. <br><br>

“We can’t just tell them the truth! There will be protests, and we don’t need that right now.” one of the king’s generals exclaims. <br><br>

“Enough!” the king shouts, fed up with everyone shouting ideas, arguments, remarks, all of it. “The public deserves to know what’s going on. I’ve always prided myself on the fact that the royal family has been open to the public about what’s going on in  the palace. I’m not losing that now. I know that it’s extremely risky to tell them, for it could make the murderer more desperate, but we need to. I owe it to this kingdom to do at least that. We need to come up with a plan that lets the public know about what’s going on without freaking them out. They need to know that we have this situation under control, and that nothing like this will happen again.”<br><br>

The council shuts up at the king’s message. <br><br>

“Jake, son? Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?” the king asks him.<br><br>

“What! You’re asking a sixteen year old child how to handle this instead of one of us! He has barely any experience in this stuff. The rest of us have been doing this more than half of our lives! How can you trust his judgment more than one of us!” General Morgan protests, making the king angry.<br><br>

“How dare you talk to my son like that. And to answer your question, I trust my son’s judgment better than yours because my son knows when not to state his opinion out of turn. He also doesn’t go around shouting how inexperienced everyone is. I could list about a hundred things about you that I don’t like, about how inexperienced you are, and how immature you are, but you don’t see me doing that. Now, I suggest you keep quiet for the rest of this meeting. If not, then you will be sent to the dungeons, and we will figure out your punishment from there.” the king scolds. 
Thankfully, he shut up. Nobody challenges the king. Especially when he’s threatening your life. <br><br>

Jake thought over all of the options that the palace has in telling the kingdom about what happened, and figured out the best possible option. He explains this to the council, and they all nod in agreement, also surprised that a sixteen year old knows so much about politics.<br><br> 

After some more discussion, the meeting adjourned.<br><br>

Jake exited the council room and went in search of Olivia. Thankfully, he didn’t have to look too hard, for he saw her rounding the corner, laughing at something that Miles said.<br><br> 

“Well, if it isn’t the twins. Tell me, what type of mischief did you two get into today?” Jake asked them, smirking. <br><br>

“We weren’t up to anything! I swear!” Olivia shouted, throwing her hands up in defense. <br><br>

“Sure….. Hey, Olivia, can I talk to you for a moment?” <br><br>

She nodded, bids Miles farewell, then followed Jake down the corridor. <br><br>

“What’s up?” <br><br>

“I think you should check his room.” Jake suggests.<br><br>

“Why?”<br><br>

“Did something happen before he……. You know…….?”<br><br>

“I just gave him some samples that I needed him to examine.” Olivia responded. <br><br>

“That’s it. I think the reason he was….. You know…. Was because he found something. I think that you should check his room to see if he found out anything before….. You know…..” <br><br>

“I’ll try.”<br><br>

And with that, she strolled down the corridor, walking towards her quarters. <br>
        <p align= "center"> <img src= "pixil-frame-0 (1).png"> </p>
</p>
    
    <p>Jake’s suggestion kept nagging at her mind. She kept thinking about whether she should check out his room, but she could never bring herself to do it. There were too many memories there. Since their rooms are right beside each other, whenever she would hear him cry when he was little, she would always come in to comfort him. It was still hard to believe that someone thought that they should murder a fifteen year old boy. 
In the end, she shoved her feelings aside, and made her way towards Donovan’s door. She stood in front of the door, hesitating. With shaky hands, she slowly turns the knob, stepping into the room. The maids did a good job because it looks like nothing happened.<br><br> 

If she closed her eyes, she could imagine that everything was like it was three years ago. Those were probably the best years of her life. Miles and her were seventeen years old, Jake was thirteen, and Donovan was eleven. Back then, she didn’t have a care in the world. Her and her siblings get along so well that you would think that it’s a miracle that siblings got along so well, but then again, their twins. They have some telepathic thing that lets them to understand one another better. Back then, she didn’t have to worry about a murderer lurking in the palace. She didn’t have to worry about her brother training him and the guard until they dropped to protect the castle. She didn’t have to think that her other brother would be murdered just a few minutes after she just saw him.<br><br> 

The problem was that she always knew that her life would be. When her and her brother turned 21, her brother would have to be married to some girl from the kingdom so that the Ambrose line could continue. Olivia on the other hand was to marry the prince of Ilratheino. Her father told her when she was fifteen that she would have to marry him so that when one kingdom did eventually win the war, the peace would remain. Or if the war was still going on, their marriage would end it. She’s had the pleasure to meet him once before, and he didn’t seem too bad, but she still doesn’t want to marry him. She would prefer to marry someone that she truly cares about, not some entitled prince that thinks that he owns the world. Sadly for her, her birthday is two weeks, which means that she will have to marry the prince a few months later.<br><br> 

She missed her life when she was young. And now, nothing will ever be the same. <br><br>

OIivia flicks on the lights to Donovan’s study, heart aching just standing there. She walks over to the station where she knew that Donovan used to experiment and looks around. She’s looking through stacks of paper, in drawers, in anything that could possibly give her some information about the phials that she gave him. She’s rummaging through drawers, when she comes across one drawer that is locked. She looks for the key, but it’s nowhere to be seen. Knowing Donovan, he probably had the key on him after he locked the drawer. With this information, she knew that she would have to lock pick the drawer. Thankfully for her, being an expert in investigation, she was taught how to lock pick anything. She pulls out the silver lock picking set that her father gave her for her birthday a few years ago, and starts to unlock the drawer. She finally gets the drawer open with a lot of effort, and pulls it open.<br><br> 

Inside the drawer is a giant stack of papers, some of which are copies of information that the palace got Donovan to study. But resting on the top of the stack was exactly what she was looking for. One double sided sheet of paper that gives Olivia all of the information that she needs to continue with her investigation. She folds up the paper and shoves it into the pocket of the training jumper that she’s still wearing. <br><br>
</p>
    
    <p>She exited Donovan’s study, and headed to her own. She changed into a pair of black leggings, a purple t-shirt, a pair of black combat boots, and a navy blue hoodie. She transferred the paper into the pocket of her hoodie and headed straight to her father.<br><br> 

She knocked onto the doors to her father’s study, and waited. One of her father’s servants opened the doors, and she walked in.<br><br> 

“How may I help you?” her father asked.<br><br>

“I was looking through Donovan’s study, and found some important information..”<br><br>

“Thank you, Olivia. That is much appreciated. I know how hard it must have been to go there. Why don’t you tell me and the generals this at our next council meeting. It will be tomorrow at noon.”<br>

<h1>Chapter Three</h1>

 <p>Back in the dining hall, the servants have cleaned up the mess from the night before, and the royal family has sat down to eat. The king and queen are sitting at the heads of the table, opposite of each other, with their children on either side of the table. Miles is sitting to Darius’s right with Jake beside him, and on the other side of the table, Olivia is sitting to her mother’s right, and the chair beside her empty.<br><br>

“Olivia, sweety, do you know where your brother is?” Queen Fiona asked. <br><br>

“No, I have no clue. The last time I saw him was when I gave him the results of our search today.” Olivia responded, worried about where her brother could be.<br><br> 

They’ve been waiting for fifteen minutes now, and Donovan still hasn’t shown up yet. He’s never been late before. Usually it’s anyone except Donovan and Queen Fiona that’s late. Sometimes Olivia takes too long to get ready. Miles is usually training and loses track of time. Jake is usually reviewing the events that are happening throughout the kingdom. And Darius is usually held up in meetings most of the time, making him late to dinner. But Donovan being late is very unlikely. 

Worried about her brother, Olivia gets up from the table.<br><br>

“Where are you going?” Darius asked her. <br><br>

“I’m worried about Donovan. He’s never late to dinner. I fear something bad has happened to him.” she replied. <br><br>

The rest of her family followed her out of the dining hall, and they made their way up to Donovan’s study. When they reach his study, the door is slightly ajar. Olivia pushes the door open and screams. Tears are running down her face at the sight. Her brother’s body lay motionless on the ground, surrounded by a pool of blood and a knife in his heart. Not caring about her dress anymore, she kneels beside her brother, entangling her hand in his, crying over his body. 

Queen Fiona sobs as well, kneeling beside her daughter. The remaining princes have mixed emotions spread across their faces. Shock, anger, sadness, grief, and sorrow mixed together. And King Darius, known for always staying strong, no matter what, showing no emotion whatsoever, lets a tear fall down his face. The only sign that people will see that he’s upset about his son's death. Outside, he has to stay strong for his family, but inside he’s broken. He’d never thought that he would live to see the day that one of his children would be stabbed through the heart. He knew that he would do anything in his power to avenge his son, and stop this mad man. 

On shaky legs, Olivia slowly gets up and stands beside her brothers. She has to lean against Miles to keep her upright, or else she will collapse on the floor. Out of all of the siblings, Olivia was definitely the closest with Donovan, and now that he’s gone, she feels empty inside. Miles places his arm around her shoulders in an attempt to comfort her. Tears are still falling down Olivia’s face, unable to stop them. She wipes her face, trying to remove as many tears as possible, and retreats into Miles’s comforting shape. He pulls her closer, wrapping his arms around her in a hug. 

After a long time, the royal family finally leaves his room, and orders the servants to prepare his body for the funeral. The one thing they did do before they left was take the knife out of his chest. The king holds it with a glove, making sure not to get his fingerprints on it. <br>

    <p>The next morning, a funeral is planned for the death of Donovan Ambrose, the youngest son of King Darius and Queen Fiona. The queen and princess are both dressed in long, black mourning gowns. Their eyes reveal the amount of grief and sadness they have. The king and princes are in their uniforms, with a new patch on their arm, representing Donovan’s personal crest. A black rose surrounded by blue flames. Each member of the royal family has one, and whenever a member of the family dies, the remaining members of the family sew their crest onto their uniform as a sign of respect. 

The royal family says their final goodbyes to Donovan, then he is left to rest with the rest of the deceased Ambrose family. 

Olivia has tears slowly falling down her face, attempting not to break out into full blown tears. The king is trying to stay strong for his family, but you could still tell that he’s still grieving. The princes are about to break, and the queen also has tears down her face. 

The public was also invited to watch the funeral, and they all had a look of mourning on their faces for the loss of one of the princes of Eslarthia.<br><br> 

When his body is covered up, Olivia and Miles walk over to the tombstone carved with his crest and the Ambrose crest and place a bouquet of flowers next to it. The bouquet was a bouquet of black roses, Donovan’s favorite. Also the reason why that flower is on his crest. Your crest is made up of the flower that you like, and something that represents you. Donovan always loved the black roses in the palace gardens, and the blue fire, which symbolized that he may be the youngest of the family, but he will always burn the brightest. 
The two siblings walk away, Olivia about to break, and Miles about to start crying. 

The public soon files out of the courtyard, and the royal family returns to the palace. 

That night, no one could sleep. Olivia cried all night because of her dead brother. Miles and Jake were scared that they would be next to follow their dead brother, and in the privacy of their own rooms, they too shed tears for their brother. Queen Fiona was a sobbing mess because of her son’s death, and King Darius finally broke.<br>

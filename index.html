    <h1>Eternal Empires</h1>
    
    <h4>Long ago, the Kingdom of Eslarthia and Ilratheino were at war. A hundred years later, Eslarthia ended the war when they defeated the Ilratheino king in a duel. Ilratheino surrendered, and Eslarthia gained power over the entire continent. Little did Eslarthia know that Ilratheino was prepared for their defeat. <br><br>

In the palace of Eslarthia, the king was throwing a feast for the entire palace. All of the generals, captains, noblemen, and wives were invited.“Let us celebrate the victory over the kingdom of Ilratheino! We now have control over our entire continent. Let our reign last for generations to come!” The king shouted, raising his glass, and everyone joined in.<br> 

The feast commenced, and everyone was enjoying themselves.<br><br>

The lords and ladies talked to each other on how their family was of great help to the war. The generals were going over more war strategies, and the royal family was content. Sadly, this happiness couldn’t last long. <br>

Everyone stopped eating and talking because they heard strangled breathing, and gurgling. They looked down the long table to see that the king’s right-hand man was holding his neck, barely breathing. A few seconds later, he died. Medics arrived as fast as they could, and examined him to see how exactly he died. When they were done, the only conclusion they had was that he was poisoned. There was nothing blocking his airway, and he didn’t have any severe allergies, so poison was the only possible solution. <br>

The king ended the feast immediately, and told everyone to be on high alert in case anything like this should happen again. <br>

The royal family went to the throne room with his generals to discuss what to do next. They were all still in shock at what happened back at the feast, but were determined to stop whatever was going on. <br>

“The problem is that we don’t have any idea who poisoned General Carlos.” one of the generals said.<br></h4>
    
    
    <h4>“Very true. We need to get to the bottom of this, no matter what. Olivia, I want you to round up the best scholars in the kingdom and investigate this further.” King Darius commanded. <br><br>

“Of course, father.” Olivia replied.<br><br>

“Captain Adrien and Max, I want you two to round up the guards. Train them as hard as you can so that when Olivia does find out who poisoned General Carlos, the guard will be ready to hunt them down.” 
“Yes, your majesty.” Captain Adrien answered, and Miles, the crowned prince, nodded in agreement. <br><br>

“Donovan, I want you to go and research all you can about the available poisons in the kingdom, that would be greatly appreciated. Also, could you be able to make a few antidotes for those poisons as well? We don’t want another incident to happen.” The king asks his youngest son.<br><br>

“Absolutely.”<br><br>

“Thank you. And Jake, I want you to help me with the political aspect of this matter. We don’t want the kingdom freaking out about this. We need to make sure that the kingdom knows about the danger that this person possesses, but we also need them to not panic about this.”<br><br>

And so, that’s what everyone did. After the meeting was over, the king’s children immediately went to their tasks at hand. Olivia went to the scholars’ wing to see what they could find out about the poison. Captain Adrien and Mileswent to the barracks and trained them from dawn to dusk. Donovan went to his study where he keeps most of his experiments on poisons, and all of those things. He requested that his sister bring him a sample of General Carlos’s blood to see which poison was used on him. And Jake, King Darius, Queen Fiona, and the rest of the Generals worked on how they would present this news to the kingdom.<br><br>

In the dining hall, Princess Olivia and the scholars are examining the body of General Carlos. <br><br>

“Who do you think did this?” Addam asks us. <br><br>

“Not sure.” Olivia replied. <br><br>

Olivia had chosen a group of six scholars to help you investigate this case. These six scholars are the best in the kingdom, and she happened to be friends with all of them. <br><br>

When she was little, she read all of these mystery books and movies. She loved investigating cases and solving mysteries. She did this so much that she was named the best detective in the entire kingdom. So, whenever her father would need someone to investigate something, Olivia was his go to person.</h4> 

      <h4> Olivia wasn’t wearing her usual gown and tiara because she’s investigating the death of General Carlos. Instead, she was wearing black leggings, a navy blue shirt, and a pair of combat boots. She has her dark brown hair pulled into a tight bun so it doesn’t fall in front of her face. She’s kneeling beside the body of General Carlos, trying to figure out what type of poison was used. Her brother had told her to give him as much of a description about the body as possible, because it would help him figure out what type of poison was used. 

She examined his face closely, and noticed that his veins were so clear, it looked like his skin was made out of glass. At the corners of his mouth, white froth was evident, and his eyes were bloodshot. She took note of all of this in her notebook, and got up to examine the rest of the room. Her father had ordered that nothing be moved from the dining hall so we could get a better understanding of what happened. 

She had sent a few of the scholars to go down to the cellars and kitchens to see if someone had tampered with the food or drinks. The rest of them were helping her in the dining hall. <br><br>

“Addam, Parker, Mia, can you three go check to see if any of the other generals’ drinks were tampered with. They probably weren’t, since they’re still alive, but we can’t be too sure.” she says. <br><br>

Olivia walks over to where General Carlos was sitting last night to see what exactly had happened to him. The food couldn’t have been poisoned, since everyone had been taking food off of the giant platters in the center of the table. So, the only possibility was that the poison was in his drink. She picked up his glass, and swirled the wine around. It looked fine to her, but she didn’t want to take the chance to drink it herself. One thing she did notice was that the wine had a bluish tint to it, so she poured a sample of the wine into a glass phial, and shoved the phial into her pocket. She then walked back over to General Carlos’s body and drew a blood sample from him and also placed the sample in a glass phial. She shoved that phial into her pocket as well, then stood up.<br><br>

“Did any of you find anything important?” she asked.<br><br>

“We don’t believe that the other drinks have been tampered with. The food looks fine, and everything else looks normal.” Parker answered.<br><br>

The four of them heard footsteps approaching the dining hall, and they all spun around to see that it was just the rest of the scholars. 

“What did you three find?” Olivia asked them. <br><br>
“Nothing was wrong in the cellars or the kitchens, but we did find this.” a scholar with long, wavy black hair said, handing Olivia a bottle. 
        <br><br>

        “What is this?”</h3>
    
    <h3>“We believe it’s poison. We don’t know who it belongs to though. We saw the bottle resting on the counter.” <br><br>
      
     “Thank you, Emily. I will get this to my brother as soon as possible. Well, thank you all for your time. I think I have enough information for today. If you don’t mind, we’ll start again, same time tomorrow.” Olivia told them, exiting the dining hall.<br><br>

She made her way through the large castle, and up the stairs to her youngest brother’s room. She knocked on the door, and a few seconds later, a voice called for her to enter. <br><br>

“Hey, Donovan. I brought you the samples you asked for.” she says, handing him all three phials and the paper with the description about General Carlos.<br><br>

“I only asked for one. What are the other two?” he asks. <br><br>

“One of them is a blood sample. The other is a wine sample. And the other one Emily gave me. She told me that they found it on the counter in the kitchen. I think it’s poison, but I’m not exactly sure. I’m giving you all three to see if you can figure out if the poison in General Carlos’s blood is the same thing that’s in the other two phials. If so, we need to figure out who poisoned him before he kills anyone else.” Olivia responds. <br><br>

“Thanks, sis. I’ll do my best.”<br><br>

And with that, Olivia returned to her room to change. Since she’s no longer investigating, and that it’s just about dinner time, she has to change back into her usual gown and tiara. She changed into a sky blue gown and heels. Brushed her hair out and curled it slightly. Applied some make-up, and some jewelry. Once she was done, she made her way down to the throne room.

After Olivia left his room, Donovan immediately went to work on examining the phials that she gave her. He looked at the paper that she handed him, and knew the symptoms of the poison immediately. The moonshadow poison is the most deadly poison in the entire continent. It was so rare that the only people to own it are the royal families of both kingdoms. He knew for a fact that the only time his family has ever used the moonshadow poison was because a decade ago, there was a mass murderer and was going insane. That was the only time in the entire history of the Ambrose family ruling Eslarthia had used it. That meant that the Whitlock family poisoned the General. The question was how. 

Just to be safe, Donovan ran a few tests on the samples, and they all returned with the same answer. Moonshadow poison. He locks the results into a drawer in my desk in case that there are spies in the castle, then heads towards the door. Before he's able to get there though, he feels a hand on my shoulder. He slowly turns around to see a person staring back at him with gleaming eyes. Before he can let out a scream in warning, the person lifts his hand to reveal a blade, and stabs it through his heart.  

Donovan drops to the ground, blood pooling around him.</h4>
    
    <h4>Back in the dining hall, the servants have cleaned up the mess from the night before, and the royal family has sat down to eat. The king and queen are sitting at the heads of the table, opposite of each other, with their children on either side of the table. Miles is sitting to Darius’s right with Jake beside him, and on the other side of the table, Olivia is sitting to her mother’s right, and the chair beside her empty.<br><br>

“Olivia, sweety, do you know where your brother is?” Queen Fiona asked. <br><br>

“No, I have no clue. The last time I saw him was when I gave him the results of our search today.” Olivia responded, worried about where her brother could be.<br><br> 

They’ve been waiting for fifteen minutes now, and Donovan still hasn’t shown up yet. He’s never been late before. Usually it’s anyone except Donovan and Queen Fiona that’s late. Sometimes Olivia takes too long to get ready. Miles is usually training and loses track of time. Jake is usually reviewing the events that are happening throughout the kingdom. And Darius is usually held up in meetings most of the time, making him late to dinner. But Donovan being late is very unlikely. 

Worried about her brother, Olivia gets up from the table.<br><br>

“Where are you going?” Darius asked her. <br><br>

“I’m worried about Donovan. He’s never late to dinner. I fear something bad has happened to him.” she replied. <br><br>

The rest of her family followed her out of the dining hall, and they made their way up to Donovan’s study. When they reach his study, the door is slightly ajar. Olivia pushes the door open and screams. Tears are running down her face at the sight. Her brother’s body lay motionless on the ground, surrounded by a pool of blood and a knife in his heart. Not caring about her dress anymore, she kneels beside her brother, entangling her hand in his, crying over his body. 

Queen Fiona sobs as well, kneeling beside her daughter. The remaining princes have mixed emotions spread across their faces. Shock, anger, sadness, grief, and sorrow mixed together. And King Darius, known for always staying strong, no matter what, showing no emotion whatsoever, lets a tear fall down his face. The only sign that people will see that he’s upset about his son's death. Outside, he has to stay strong for his family, but inside he’s broken. He’d never thought that he would live to see the day that one of his children would be stabbed through the heart. He knew that he would do anything in his power to avenge his son, and stop this mad man. 

On shaky legs, Olivia slowly gets up and stands beside her brothers. She has to lean against Miles to keep her upright, or else she will collapse on the floor. Out of all of the siblings, Olivia was definitely the closest with Donovan, and now that he’s gone, she feels empty inside. Miles places his arm around her shoulders in an attempt to comfort her. Tears are still falling down Olivia’s face, unable to stop them. She wipes her face, trying to remove as many tears as possible, and retreats into Miles’s comforting shape. He pulls her closer, wrapping his arms around her in a hug. 

After a long time, the royal family finally leaves his room, and orders the servants to prepare his body for the funeral. The one thing they did do before they left was take the knife out of his chest. The king holds it with a glove, making sure not to get his fingerprints on it. 
</h4>

    <h4>The next morning, a funeral is planned for the death of Donovan Ambrose, the youngest son of King Darius and Queen Fiona. The queen and princess are both dressed in long, black mourning gowns. Their eyes reveal the amount of grief and sadness they have. The king and princes are in their uniforms, with a new patch on their arm, representing Donovan’s personal crest. A black rose surrounded by blue flames. Each member of the royal family has one, and whenever a member of the family dies, the remaining members of the family sew their crest onto their uniform as a sign of respect. 

The royal family says their final goodbyes to Donovan, then he is left to rest with the rest of the deceased Ambrose family. 

Olivia has tears slowly falling down her face, attempting not to break out into full blown tears. The king is trying to stay strong for his family, but you could still tell that he’s still grieving. The princes are about to break, and the queen also has tears down her face. 

The public was also invited to watch the funeral, and they all had a look of mourning on their faces for the loss of one of the princes of Eslarthia.<br><br> 

When his body is covered up, Olivia and Miles walk over to the tombstone carved with his crest and the Ambrose crest and place a bouquet of flowers next to it. The bouquet was a bouquet of black roses, Donovan’s favorite. Also the reason why that flower is on his crest. Your crest is made up of the flower that you like, and something that represents you. Donovan always loved the black roses in the palace gardens, and the blue fire, which symbolized that he may be the youngest of the family, but he will always burn the brightest. 
The two siblings walk away, Olivia about to break, and Miles about to start crying. 

The public soon files out of the courtyard, and the royal family returns to the palace. 

That night, no one could sleep. Olivia cried all night because of her dead brother. Miles and Jake were scared that they would be next to follow their dead brother, and in the privacy of their own rooms, they too shed tears for their brother. Queen Fiona was a sobbing mess because of her son’s death, and King Darius finally broke.
</h4>
    
    <h4>The next morning, everyone was tired, sad, and on edge. Every little thing ticked them off. For the king, if a servant had accidentally been late in getting him a drink, instead of ignoring it like usual, he snapped at them, sending the servant running away to fetch another one. For Olivia, if a maid had pulled on her hair too tight, she would snap at them, and send all of the maids out of her room and tell them that she could do it herself. Miles was training until he would drop in the barracks, needing to take his anger out on something. And Jake was constantly running through the events of the kingdom, trying to preoccupy himself with anything that could take his mind off of Donovan.<br><br> 

Olivia wasn’t in the mood to investigate the case today. She left the investigating to the scholars, trusting them not to screw things up. She told them to find as much out about Donovan’s death as possible, and to figure out who the fingerprint on the knife belonged to. <br><br>

After breakfast, she changed into her training outfit, and joined Miles to the barracks. <br><br>

“So, why is my little sister training today? Why aren’t you investigating right now?” Miles asked her, playfully shoving her shoulder. <br><br>

“I’m younger than you by two minutes.” she retorts, rolling her eyes at him.<br><br>

“Still older though. Now seriously, answer the question.”<br><br>

“I don’t feel like it. Not after……… you know……… Why do you ask? Do you not want me to join you?”<br><br>

“Of course not! You’re always welcome to train with me. I only asked because it’s not like you. And I get it. I know how much he meant to you. He meant a lot to me too. I know that it’s way too early to say this to you know, but you can’t grieve about him forever. The kingdom needs you now more than ever to figure out who is behind this case. And besides, he wouldn’t want you to either. He would want you to celebrate life with everything you have. Not be stuck in the past, thinking about what you could do differently.” Miles says.<br><br>

“Thanks, Miles. Now, come on. I’ll race you there!” Olivia shouts, bolting towards the barracks. <br><br>

Miles rolls his eyes and chases after her. <br><br>

They make it to the barracks, doubled over, trying to catch their breath. <br><br>

“How are you so fast?” Miles asks her, gasping for air.<br><br>

“Training. Now, come on. We’re here, aren’t we? Let’s get started.”<br><br>
    </h4>
    
    <h4>Back in the palace, Jake is doing everything he can to get his mind off of Donovan. <br><br>

Currently, he’s in a meeting with his father and the generals of the kingdom, trying to figure out how to tell the public. All they know right now about all of this is that the prince is dead. They don’t know how he died at all, nor do they know about General Carlos being murdered either. <br><br>

“We can’t just tell them the truth! There will be protests, and we don’t need that right now.” one of the king’s generals exclaims. <br><br>

“Enough!” the king shouts, fed up with everyone shouting ideas, arguments, remarks, all of it. “The public deserves to know what’s going on. I’ve always prided myself on the fact that the royal family has been open to the public about what’s going on in  the palace. I’m not losing that now. I know that it’s extremely risky to tell them, for it could make the murderer more desperate, but we need to. I owe it to this kingdom to do at least that. We need to come up with a plan that lets the public know about what’s going on without freaking them out. They need to know that we have this situation under control, and that nothing like this will happen again.”<br><br>

The council shuts up at the king’s message. <br><br>

“Jake, son? Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?” the king asks him.<br><br>

“What! You’re asking a sixteen year old child how to handle this instead of one of us! He has barely any experience in this stuff. The rest of us have been doing this more than half of our lives! How can you trust his judgment more than one of us!” General Morgan protests, making the king angry.<br><br>

“How dare you talk to my son like that. And to answer your question, I trust my son’s judgment better than yours because my son knows when not to state his opinion out of turn. He also doesn’t go around shouting how inexperienced everyone is. I could list about a hundred things about you that I don’t like, about how inexperienced you are, and how immature you are, but you don’t see me doing that. Now, I suggest you keep quiet for the rest of this meeting. If not, then you will be sent to the dungeons, and we will figure out your punishment from there.” the king scolds. 
Thankfully, he shut up. Nobody challenges the king. Especially when he’s threatening your life. <br><br>

Jake thought over all of the options that the palace has in telling the kingdom about what happened, and figured out the best possible option. He explains this to the council, and they all nod in agreement, also surprised that a sixteen year old knows so much about politics.<br><br> 

After some more discussion, the meeting adjourned.<br><br>

Jake exited the council room and went in search of Olivia. Thankfully, he didn’t have to look too hard, for he saw her rounding the corner, laughing at something that Miles said.<br><br> 

“Well, if it isn’t the twins. Tell me, what type of mischief did you two get into today?” Jake asked them, smirking. <br><br>

“We weren’t up to anything! I swear!” Olivia shouted, throwing her hands up in defense. <br><br>

“Sure….. Hey, Olivia, can I talk to you for a moment?” <br><br>

She nodded, bids Miles farewell, then followed Jake down the corridor. <br><br>

“What’s up?” <br><br>

“I think you should check his room.” Jake suggests.<br><br>

“Why?”<br><br>

“Did something happen before he……. You know…….?”<br><br>

“I just gave him some samples that I needed him to examine.” Olivia responded. <br><br>

“That’s it. I think the reason he was….. You know…. Was because he found something. I think that you should check his room to see if he found out anything before….. You know…..” <br><br>

“I’ll try.”<br><br>

And with that, she strolled down the corridor, walking towards her quarters. 
</h4>
    
    <h4>Jake’s suggestion kept nagging at her mind. She kept thinking about whether she should check out his room, but she could never bring herself to do it. There were too many memories there. Since their rooms are right beside each other, whenever she would hear him cry when he was little, she would always come in to comfort him. It was still hard to believe that someone thought that they should murder a fifteen year old boy. 
In the end, she shoved her feelings aside, and made her way towards Donovan’s door. She stood in front of the door, hesitating. With shaky hands, she slowly turns the knob, stepping into the room. The maids did a good job because it looks like nothing happened.<br><br> 

If she closed her eyes, she could imagine that everything was like it was three years ago. Those were probably the best years of her life. Miles and her were seventeen years old, Jake was thirteen, and Donovan was eleven. Back then, she didn’t have a care in the world. Her and her siblings get along so well that you would think that it’s a miracle that siblings got along so well, but then again, their twins. They have some telepathic thing that lets them to understand one another better. Back then, she didn’t have to worry about a murderer lurking in the palace. She didn’t have to worry about her brother training him and the guard until they dropped to protect the castle. She didn’t have to think that her other brother would be murdered just a few minutes after she just saw him.<br><br> 

The problem was that she always knew that her life would be. When her and her brother turned 21, her brother would have to be married to some girl from the kingdom so that the Ambrose line could continue. Olivia on the other hand was to marry the prince of Ilratheino. Her father told her when she was fifteen that she would have to marry him so that when one kingdom did eventually win the war, the peace would remain. Or if the war was still going on, their marriage would end it. She’s had the pleasure to meet him once before, and he didn’t seem too bad, but she still doesn’t want to marry him. She would prefer to marry someone that she truly cares about, not some entitled prince that thinks that he owns the world. Sadly for her, her birthday is two weeks, which means that she will have to marry the prince a few months later.<br><br> 

She missed her life when she was young. And now, nothing will ever be the same. <br><br>

OIivia flicks on the lights to Donovan’s study, heart aching just standing there. She walks over to the station where she knew that Donovan used to experiment and looks around. She’s looking through stacks of paper, in drawers, in anything that could possibly give her some information about the phials that she gave him. She’s rummaging through drawers, when she comes across one drawer that is locked. She looks for the key, but it’s nowhere to be seen. Knowing Donovan, he probably had the key on him after he locked the drawer. With this information, she knew that she would have to lock pick the drawer. Thankfully for her, being an expert in investigation, she was taught how to lock pick anything. She pulls out the silver lock picking set that her father gave her for her birthday a few years ago, and starts to unlock the drawer. She finally gets the drawer open with a lot of effort, and pulls it open.<br><br> 

Inside the drawer is a giant stack of papers, some of which are copies of information that the palace got Donovan to study. But resting on the top of the stack was exactly what she was looking for. One double sided sheet of paper that gives Olivia all of the information that she needs to continue with her investigation. She folds up the paper and shoves it into the pocket of the training jumper that she’s still wearing. <br><br>
</h4>
    
    <h4>She exited Donovan’s study, and headed to her own. She changed into a pair of black leggings, a purple t-shirt, a pair of black combat boots, and a navy blue hoodie. She transferred the paper into the pocket of her hoodie and headed straight to her father.<br><br> 

She knocked onto the doors to her father’s study, and waited. One of her father’s servants opened the doors, and she walked in.<br><br> 

“How may I help you?” her father asked.<br><br>

“I was looking through Donovan’s study, and found some important information..”<br><br>

“Thank you, Olivia. That is much appreciated. I know how hard it must have been to go there. Why don’t you tell me and the generals this at our next council meeting. It will be tomorrow at noon.”<br><br>
</h4>
    
    <h4>The next day, Olivia was sitting beside her mother around the large table that the council was gathered around. <br><br>

“Your majesty, not to be rude at all, but may I ask why your children are going to us today?” one of the generals asked the king, motioning towards Olivia and her brother, them already being used to Jake being there.<br><br> 

“Very good question, General Morgan. Though I do find you questioning my childrens’ presence at this council quite annoying. I know that you think that since they are so young, that they can’t do everything that needs to be done, but I assure you that they can. Olivia is the best investigator in the entire continent. Even Ilratheino said so, and they hate our guts. Miles is the best fighter that this world has ever seen. And Jake is more than capable at military and political strategies than the majority of you here. Now, if you’re done interrupting me, I would like to continue.” King Darius scolds.<br><br> 

“Of course, your majesty.” he nods, falling further into his seat. <br><br>

“Now, if any of you don’t have anything to add, Olivia, would you please tell us the information you have collected?” the king asked her. <br><br>

“Of course.” Olivia says, standing up. “When me and the scholars investigated the dinner after General Carlos’s death, I noticed that his wine had a bluish tint to it. My late brother wanted me to give him a blood sample so he can figure out exactly which type of poison was used on him. I also sent some scholars into the kitchens to see if they could find anything there. When they came back, one of the scholars gave me a small phial filled ¾ of the way with a clear liquid. I made sure that every single one of us were wearing gloves to make sure that we didn’t get any fingerprints on anything. I took a blood sample and a wine sample, then handed all three of the phials to my late brother to see if he could get any information on them. Sadly, he isn’t here right now to tell us his findings himself, but he did find out two important things. One; the poison that was used on General Carlos is Moonshadow poison. The most deadly poison in the entire continent. One thing he also found was a fingerprint on the phial containing the poison.<br><br>
</h4>
    
    <h4>“After my brother’s death, I got the scholars to run some tests on the knife that killed him. When I get the results back, I can see if the fingerprints are the same on the phial, as the ones on the knife. Until further notice, I have no other information about the investigation about the murderer.”  <br><br>

“Thank you, Olivia. General Adrien, Miles, status on the guard?” <br><br>

“The guard is ready for the first sign of the enemy.” General Adrien answers. <br><br>

“Very good. Jake, any ideas for progress on the issue at hand?” <br><br>

“I have processed every possible way of telling the public and the outcome that each way would have, and I have figured out the best way forward. I suggest that first, we make sure that the public knows the true reason as to why Donovan was killed. If not, they are going to get suspicious, and we don’t need them to start getting the wrong ideas. After that, we will tell them that General Carlos is dead. We can tell them that he was poisoned, but not the type of poison that was used. If we do, chaos and mayhem will ensue. We will then post the guard on the outskirts of the kingdom, preventing the murderer from escaping, and to assure the public that they are safe within the kingdom, and that we won’t let the murderer get away unharmed. And Miles, Olivia, I’m sorry about this, but you two would need to be engaged as soon as possible. Miles, we would have to throw a ball to find you a suitable match, and Olivia, we would need you to be engaged to Prince Emerson. We need our kingdom to think that we are strong.” Jake explains. <br><br>

At the mention of having to be engaged soon, Olivia was angry. She always knew that this day would come, but she hoped she’d at least have a week or two to get it together. Not a few days. <br><br>

For Miles, he hated the idea of being engaged to a complete stranger. Sure that it’s for the better of the kingdom, but he still hated the idea. He at least wanted to know the person before he had to marry them. He had one girl in mind that he wanted to marry, but he knew that it was quite unlikely that his parents would allow that. Then again, even though it’s protocol to throw a huge gala and the prince chooses one girl from the gala to marry, his father never did that. He married his mother because he truly loved her. Maybe his father would allow him to do the same. 

He met this girl when he was sixteen because of one of the feasts that his father threw. He wanted to convince her father to sell him something, and invited his family to join them for dinner. She was only a few months younger than him, and she helped her father at work. His father periodically asked her family to join them for dinner, and hoped that their children would have a connection.  <br><br>
    </h4>
    
    <h4>After a few dinners together, Miles learned that her name was Scarlet Cyprus. Her and her father ran the best blacksmith shop in the entire kingdom. If he was being honest, she was very pretty. She had long, silky, honey blonde hair, ocean blue eyes and a smile that could light up the room. Every time that his father said that her father would be joining them for dinner, he would always hope that Scarlet would be coming as well. At this point, it was very clear to him that he liked her, but he was sure that she would never like him back.<br><br> 

He was never the child with the looks. Olivia has long, silky, dark brown hair, almond eyes, and curves that compliment her features. Jake has messy dirty blond hair, but not so messy that he looks like he just woke up. He has soft green eyes and a kind smile. Miles on the other hand has messy dark brown hair that is always a hassle to contain, his brown eyes are the same as his father’s, no matter what his mood, his eyes always look like he’s angry. Sure, he’s built strong, but it’s kind of hard to see under the suit that his father always makes him wear. <br><br>

Miles realized that he was zoning out in the thought of the ball that he wasn’t paying any attention to what his father was saying. <br><br>

“-And if any of you don’t have anything else to add, this meeting is adjourned.” King Darius announces, standing up and signaling for his family to join him. <br><br>

Two days later, much to Olivia’s dismay, her father invited the Whitlock family to stay at the palace for a while. Her and Prince Emerson both knew that this day would come, but it didn’t mean that they wanted it to happen, but they knew that it’s for the better of both kingdoms that this marriage happens. <br><br>

The royal family is currently standing on the steps to the palace, awaiting the arrival of the other royal family. <br><br>

Not a minute later, four horses drawing a carriage pull up to the gates of the palace. The servants let the carriage in, and the royal family emerges from it, holding their heads high. The Ambrose family bows and curtsies to the Whitlock family in greeting.<br><br>

“Your majesties, it’s a pleasure that you were able to stay with us for a while.” King Darius addresses.<br><br> 

“Thank you for having us, your highness. I do hope that this marriage works out. Don’t want another war to happen, do we?” the other king chuckles.<br><br>

“No we don’t, King Felix. No we don’t. Please, come in.”<br><br>
      
The Ambrose family escorts the Whitlock family into the palace, catching up with each other. Little did Miles, Olivia and Jake know, but the kings actually were friends. The only reason the war ended was because the king before King Felix died because of old age, and since the two kings were friends, they ended the war in order to preserve their friendship. In order to not seem weak, King Felix let King Darius defeat him in the duel to end the war. But in the end, the two kings were still able to keep their friendship alive, and end the war. Sure,the kingdom of Ilratheino now thinks that their new king is weak, but they decide to believe the only reason he lost was because he’s a new king and since Kind Darius has been in power longer, so he’s had more training.<br><br> 

“Olivia dear, would you please escort Prince Emerson to his room please?” Queen Fiona asked.<br><br>

“Of course.” <br><br>

Olivia leads Prince Emerson down the many corridors of the palace. She stops on the fifth floor of the palace in front of two very royal looking doors. Coincidentally, his room is right beside Olivia’s. Actually, the entire Whitlock family’s rooms are on this floor. <br><br>

“Thank you, Princess Olivia.” he says, giving Olivia a mock bow. <br><br>

Olivia rolls her eyes at him and gives him a playful shove to his shoulder. <br><br>

“Careful now. Don’t want any roughhousing in the palace, do we?” Emerson asks, earning another eye roll from Olivia. <br><br>

“I’ll see you at dinner, Prince Emerson.” Olivia taunts, then heads into her room. <br><br>
    </h4>

<h4>Olivia changed into a lavender gown with silver accents, a pair of silver heels redid her make-up, lightly curled her hair, picked up her favourite book and headed towards the palace gardens. She always found comfort in the peace and quiet that came with the gardens. She sat on one of the benches and opened her book.<br><br> 

A few minutes later, she hears someone approaching, but ignores it, figuring that it’s just someone who was exploring.<br><br> 

“Can I join you?” Olivia hears a familiar voice ask. <br><br>

She looks up from her book to see Prince Emerson standing in front of her with a smile on his face. <br><br>

“Sure.” she says, returning to her book.<br><br>

“What are you reading?”<br><br>

“Just some book my father gave me when I was ten.” Olivia answers, wondering why he wanted to join her. <br><br>

“How badly do you want this marriage to happen?” <br><br>

“What?” she asks, closing her book, confused on why he asked her that.<br><br>

“How badly do you want this marriage to happen?” he repeats. <br><br>

So that’s why he’s here.<br><br>

“If I’m being honest, I don’t know. Like, I knew that this day would come, but it’s not my preferred way of getting married. But I know that it’s for the better of both kingdoms. Why?”<br><br>

“Just curious. You do know that we have to get to know each other better for this marriage to work, right?” Emerson points out. <br><br>

“Yeah, I know.”<br><br>

“So, let’s get to know each other better.”<br><br>

Olivia simply rolls her eyes at him.<br><br>

“You know, if you keep doing that, your eyes are going to get stuck up there.” <br><br>

“Come on, Mr. Whitlock. Let’s get to know each other better.”<br><br>
</h4>

<h4>The two of them walked around the gardens for a while, talking about their pasts, what they like, and stuff like that. <br><br>

“I’m sorry about your brother. I know that he meant a lot to you.” Emerson says. <br><br>

“Thanks. That means a lot. Now, I’m pretty sure that it’s dinner now. You don’t want our parents to freak out about if we’re missing or not, do you?”<br><br>

“Meh. They’ll just think that we’re together somewhere in the palace.” he shrugs. <br><br>

“That sounds wrong, Emerson. Now, come on. Let’s go.”<br><br>

The two of them head to the dinning hall and take their seats. Like usual, Olivia sits beside Queen Fiona, but instead of Donovan sitting on her left, Emerson is, and his family sitting to his left. Man, they’re really trying to get Emerson and I together. Olivia thought.<br><br>
</h4>

<h4>A few days later, Emerson and Olivia are getting along a lot better than when Emerson first arrived. General Adrien and Miles have been training the guard so hard that the second they see the murderer, he will die instantly. And King Darius and Jake have been planning the ball where Miles will choose a girl to marry, and Olivia and Emerson will announce their engagement. Sadly for all three of them, the ball is in a week. Olivia and Emerson still feel like they need to connect better before they announce to the public that they’re going to be engaged, and Miles still hasn’t had the guts to ask Scarlet to marry him. <br><br>

Miles is heading down the halls to the barracks, but is stopped by his sister running down the halls in her usual investigation outfit. She stops in front of him, gasping for breath. <br><br>

“M-Miles. C-come quick. I-It’s urgent.” she tells him between breaths. <br><br>

“Sis, what’s happening.” He asks her, grabbing her shoulders to get her to face him, worried. <br><br>

“Come with me.” she says, grabbing his wrist and taking off down the corridors. <br><br>

The two of them are running down the halls. Miles kind of recognises the direction that they’re heading in, but can’t process where he remembers it from since they’re sprinting at full speed. <br><br>

 “What’s going on!” Miles shouts.<br><br>

“There’s been another murder. Father told me to get you as soon as possible, and thank god that I know your routine, because if not, I would’ve been searching for hours.” Olivia tells him.<br><br>

Eventually, they stop at the edge of a large crowd of people<br><br>

“Move out of the way. It’s Princess Olivia and Prince Miles.” Olivia says while dragging Miles through the crowd of people that are clearing a way for them at the word of Olivia. <br><br>

“Thank god you’re here son. I’m sorry to say this, but General Adrien has been murdered.” his father says as he and Olivia reach the centre of the crowd. <br><br>

“We believe that the murder is connected to the death of Donovan and General Carlos.” Olivia adds. <br><br>

Miles takes a good look at the body and realises that what his father is saying is true. General Adrien, Miles’s mentor, his captain, has been murdered by the same person that killed his brother and General Carlos. Anger boils within Miles and swears that whoever did this will die. <br><br>

“We need to have a meeting about this ASAP. Olivia, can you and your crew gather as much evidence about this murder as you can, then meet us in the council chambers. After that, I’ll gather the generals and we’ll figure out what to do moving forward.”<br><br>

“Of course, father.” Olivia says, bowing, then assembling the scholars to start their investigation. <br><br>

“Miles, will you please follow me?” King Darius asks, walking away with Queen Fiona. <br><br>

Miles follows them back to the council chambers. Miles takes his usual seat at the table and looks to his father, looking for an explanation on why he called him there. <br><br>

“Miles, I know that you were close with General Adrien, so I offer you my sympathy about his death. In his death, the position of Captain of the Guard is now open. Now I know that the other generals will be begging to have someone in their family, or even themselves to take up the position, even though they're nowhere near the skill level that it takes to be the Captain of the Guard. To prevent this from happening, I will be choosing the new Captain myself. Even before General Adrien’s murder, I’ve known who I want the new captain to be. Miles, my son, I would like to offer you the position as the new Captain of the Guard. You have been training under General Adrien since you were a little boy, and there is no one in this kingdom that even meets the skill level you possess. So? Would you like the position?”<br><br>

“Yes, thank you. I’m honoured that you thought of me.” Miles responds. <br><br>

“Of course. I meant everything that I said. And it would be fun to work alongside my son in battle.” <br><br>
</h4>

<h4>The entire royal family and the generals are gathered around the large table in the centre of the council chamber, trying to figure out what to do next. <br><br>

“Olivia, what have you found out since the last time we were here?” King Darius asks her. <br><br>

“The most important thing that I have found out is that it was definitely the same person that killed Donovan as General Carlos. As for General Adrien, we have found out that he was also killed by the moonshadow poison. We discovered the poison in his bloodstream. We checked the kitchens again to see if there was any more poison down there, and we found another bottle. We matched up the fingerprints, and once again, it’s the same person that killed General Adrien as the rest. Whoever this person is is either hiding out in the kitchens, or works there. Father, I highly suggest that you allow us to investigate the kitchens and interview everyone there. Other than that, there is nothing else that I have to report.” Olivia informs everyone.<br><br> 

“Thank you, Olivia. Now, I know that all of you are now wondering who will be the new Captain of the Guard. Before any of you try to push yourself to that position, know that I have already chosen the person to take up that role. The only person that knows of my decision is me and my family. I will be announcing the new Captain at the ball that’s happening in a few days. If none of you have anything else you would like to say, I declare that this meeting is dismissed.” King Darius announces, and the royal family exits the chambers. <br><br>

“Fiona dear, could you please tell the Whitlock family that we would like to meet with them in fifteen please?” King Darius asks. <br><br>

“Of course.”<br><br>

“Olivia, I do need you to change though. I want you looking your best for this meeting.”<br><br>

“Yes, father.” Olivia says, nodding, then heading to her room. <br><br>

She changed into a pastel pink dress that flowed around her. The sleeves are simply pieces of fabric fluttering on top of her shoulders. She applied some silver eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara. She had her maids do her hair up into a high bun, weaving some jewels into her dark brown hair. She put on a sparkly silver crescent moon necklace with clear crystals at the base of the necklace, and diamonds embedded into the moon itself. She slipped into a pair of white heels with silver covering the last two inches. Once she knew that she was ready, she exited her room.<br><br> 

She’s walking down the corridor, when all of a sudden, she feels someone crash into her. She starts falling backwards, but the person grabs her waist, keeping her from hitting the floor.<br><br>

“Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t see you there.” the person says, which she can now make out to be Prince Emerson. <br><br>

“It’s fine. I wasn’t looking where I was going.” Olivia apologises. “I have to go to a meeting now, which I’m pretty sure that you need to get to as well.”<br><br>

“You would be correct. Am I allowed to walk you to the meeting?” <br><br>

“I don’t see why not.”<br><br>

The two of them walk towards the meeting room, arm in arm. <br><br>

“Ah, Prince Emerson, Olivia, I’m so glad that you are able to join us. Please, take your seats.” King Darius says as the two of them walk into the meeting room. <br><br>
The two of them take their seats, and the king starts the meeting. <br><br>

“As I’m sure you all know, in three days’ time, we will be throwing a ball to find Prince Miles, a princess. We hope that he will dance with his soon to be bride during this dance. I-”<br><br>

“King Darius, not to be rude or anything, but how does you hoping that your son will dance with some girl have anything to do with us?” King Felix asks.<br><br>

“We all know that my daughter, Princess Olivia, and your son, Prince Emerson are going to be engaged soon. As my son dancing with this girl will show a sign of strength within our kingdom, I think that the two of them should dance together to show a sign of strength between our two kingdoms. We’re going to be making an announcement to the kingdom about who our son has chosen to be his bride, and I was hoping that we can do the same with our daughter.” King Darius explains. <br><br>

“Of course. One question I do have is how are you going to tell the kingdom that our son is engaged to your daughter?”<br><br>

“Because this ball is bringing back an old family tradition. About five hundred years ago, my long gone grandfather, King Fredrick Ambrose, created the tradition that when a prince comes of age, a huge ball will be thrown, and he will choose a woman to be his bride. The tradition was ended about a century ago by my great grandfather, King Derek ended that tradition, saying that the prince will find his bride when he’s ready. Sure, this created an upset within the kingdom, but they eventually got used to it. But now, since we have a murderer in this kingdom, we need to look strong. And by bringing back this tradition, there will be a union between my son and the person he chooses, and there will be a union between my daughter and your son, which will show power within the kingdom.”<br><br>

And just like that, the Ambrose Twins’ fate was decided for them.<br><br>
</h4>
  
<h4>The next few days were in a hurry to get everything ready for the ball. Servants were running around all over the place to try to grab the materials needed. Chefs ask the king to confirm the menu for the ball, then re-confirm it, again and again. It’s really hectic in the palace. <br><br>

Queen Fiona and Princess Olivia have been spending the last three days picking out the perfect outfits for the ball. Given the fact that Olivia’s engagement to Prince Emerson will be announced that night, she needed to look perfect. The two of them settled on wearing dresses that represent the colours of their family. Black, gold and navy blue. <br><br>

Queen Fiona would be wearing a black, strapless dress that fades into gold, while Olivia would be wearing a navy blue dress that fades into silver closer to the bottom of the dress. Her dress itself is a dress that hugs her bodice, but flows elegantly from her waist. The shoulders of her dress are single pieces of translucent fabric that wrap around her shoulders, not on top. The dress also has ruffles that extend from her right hip down to the bottom left corner of the dress. <br><br>

She pulled out the fanciest pair of heels that she could find, and the prettiest necklaces. <br><br>

When she walks through those ballroom doors tonight, all of the eyes will be on her. <br><br>


About two hours after noon on the day of the ball, her father needed her to check on her brother, just to see if he had an idea on the girl that he would be choosing.<br><br>

She made her way towards the training grounds, given the fact that that’s where her brother normally is. She had a small feeling that he would choose the blacksmith’s daughter, since she’s seen the way he’s looked at her whenever her father would invite them over for dinner. Her suspicions were confirmed when she rounded the corner to reveal her brother kissing her. Thankfully for him, none of the guards were out at the time, so they wouldn’t have to see that. Which is probably why he was doing that. <br><br>

She decided to spare her eyes and left immediately. <br><br>

When she reached the level that her room is located, she saw Emerson making her way towards her. <br><br>

“What’s up?” she asks him when he gets close enough to hear her.<br><br>

“Nothing much. How are you feeling about the fact that after tonight, you’re going to be engaged to me?” <br><br>

“Don’t know. Why?” she shrugs.<br><br>

“You do realise that once we’re engaged, our parents are going to go full hustle on our wedding, right?” he points out.<br><br>

“Actually, they’ll most likely put my brother’s wedding in front of ours. Then again, I wouldn’t be surprised if they planned ours at the same time.” Olivia chuckles. “Well, I should probably start getting ready for the ball.”<br><br>

“Already? That's like in what? Four hours?” <br><br>

“Yeah, well, my mother still wants to go over my outfit, I have to get a massage before because my parents say ‘it helps you dance better’. I need to get my nails done. My hair takes a while-”<br><br>

“Okay, I get it. You have a lot to do. You should probably get started then.” Emerson interrupts, letting Olivia go.<br><br>

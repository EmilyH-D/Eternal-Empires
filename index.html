    <h1>Eternal Empires</h1>
    
    <h3>Long ago, the Kingdom of Eslarthia and Ilratheino were at war. A hundred years later, Eslarthia ended the war when they defeated the Ilratheino king in a duel. Ilratheino surrendered, and Eslarthia gained power over the entire continent. Little did Eslarthia know that Ilratheino was prepared for their defeat. <br><br>

In the palace of Eslarthia, the king was throwing a feast for the entire palace. All of the generals, captains, noblemen, and wives were invited.“Let us celebrate the victory over the kingdom of Ilratheino! We now have control over our entire continent. Let our reign last for generations to come!” The king shouted, raising his glass, and everyone joined in.<br> 

The feast commenced, and everyone was enjoying themselves.<br><br>

The lords and ladies talked to each other on how their family was of great help to the war. The generals were going over more war strategies, and the royal family was content. Sadly, this happiness couldn’t last long. <br>

Everyone stopped eating and talking because they heard strangled breathing, and gurgling. They looked down the long table to see that the king’s right-hand man was holding his neck, barely breathing. A few seconds later, he died. Medics arrived as fast as they could, and examined him to see how exactly he died. When they were done, the only conclusion they had was that he was poisoned. There was nothing blocking his airway, and he didn’t have any severe allergies, so poison was the only possible solution. <br>

The king ended the feast immediately, and told everyone to be on high alert in case anything like this should happen again. <br>

The royal family went to the throne room with his generals to discuss what to do next. They were all still in shock at what happened back at the feast, but were determined to stop whatever was going on. <br>

“The problem is that we don’t have any idea who poisoned General Carlos.” one of the generals said. <strong>NEW LINE HERE</strong><br></h3>
    
    
    <h3>“Very true. We need to get to the bottom of this, no matter what. Olivia, I want you to round up the best scholars in the kingdom and investigate this further.” King Darius commanded. <br><br>

“Of course, father.” Olivia replied.<br><br>

“Captain Adrien and Max, I want you two to round up the guards. Train them as hard as you can so that when Olivia does find out who poisoned General Carlos, the guard will be ready to hunt them down.” 
“Yes, your majesty.” Captain Adrien answered, and Miles, the crowned prince, nodded in agreement. <br><br>

“Donovan, I want you to go and research all you can about the available poisons in the kingdom, that would be greatly appreciated. Also, could you be able to make a few antidotes for those poisons as well? We don’t want another incident to happen.” The king asks his youngest son.<br><br>

“Absolutely.”<br><br>

“Thank you. And Jake, I want you to help me with the political aspect of this matter. We don’t want the kingdom freaking out about this. We need to make sure that the kingdom knows about the danger that this person possesses, but we also need them to not panic about this.”<br><br>

And so, that’s what everyone did. After the meeting was over, the king’s children immediately went to their tasks at hand. Olivia went to the scholars’ wing to see what they could find out about the poison. Captain Adrien and Mileswent to the barracks and trained them from dawn to dusk. Donovan went to his study where he keeps most of his experiments on poisons, and all of those things. He requested that his sister bring him a sample of General Carlos’s blood to see which poison was used on him. And Jake, King Darius, Queen Fiona, and the rest of the Generals worked on how they would present this news to the kingdom.<br><br>

In the dining hall, Princess Olivia and the scholars are examining the body of General Carlos. <br><br>

“Who do you think did this?” Emerson asks us. <br><br>

“Not sure.” Olivia replied. <br><br>

Olivia had chosen a group of six scholars to help you investigate this case. These six scholars are the best in the kingdom, and she happened to be friends with all of them. <br><br>

When she was little, she read all of these mystery books and movies. She loved investigating cases and solving mysteries. She did this so much that she was named the best detective in the entire kingdom. So, whenever her father would need someone to investigate something, Olivia was his go to person.</h3><strong>NEW LINE HERE<strong> 

      <h3> Olivia wasn’t wearing her usual gown and tiara because she’s investigating the death of General Carlos. Instead, she was wearing black leggings, a navy blue shirt, and a pair of combat boots. She has her dark brown hair pulled into a tight bun so it doesn’t fall in front of her face. She’s kneeling beside the body of General Carlos, trying to figure out what type of poison was used. Her brother had told her to give him as much of a description about the body as possible, because it would help him figure out what type of poison was used. 

She examined his face closely, and noticed that his veins were so clear, it looked like his skin was made out of glass. At the corners of his mouth, white froth was evident, and his eyes were bloodshot. She took note of all of this in her notebook, and got up to examine the rest of the room. Her father had ordered that nothing be moved from the dining hall so we could get a better understanding of what happened. 

She had sent a few of the scholars to go down to the cellars and kitchens to see if someone had tampered with the food or drinks. The rest of them were helping her in the dining hall. 

“Emerson, Parker, Mia, can you three go check to see if any of the other generals’ drinks were tampered with. They probably weren’t, since they’re still alive, but we can’t be too sure.” she says. 

Olivia walks over to where General Carlos was sitting last night to see what exactly had happened to him. The food couldn’t have been poisoned, since everyone had been taking food off of the giant platters in the center of the table. So, the only possibility was that the poison was in his drink. She picked up his glass, and swirled the wine around. It looked fine to her, but she didn’t want to take the chance to drink it herself. One thing she did notice was that the wine had a bluish tint to it, so she poured a sample of the wine into a glass phial, and shoved the phial into her pocket. She then walked back over to General Carlos’s body and drew a blood sample from him and also placed the sample in a glass phial. She shoved that phial into her pocket as well, then stood up.

“Did any of you find anything important?” she asked.

“We don’t believe that the other drinks have been tampered with. The food looks fine, and everything else looks normal.” Parker answered.

The four of them heard footsteps approaching the dining hall, and they all spun around to see that it was just the rest of the scholars. 

“What did you three find?” Olivia asked them. 
“Nothing was wrong in the cellars or the kitchens, but we did find this.” a scholar with long, wavy black hair said, handing Olivia a bottle. 

        “What is this?”</h3>

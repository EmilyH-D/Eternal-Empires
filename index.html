    <h1>Eternal Empires</h1>
    
    <h3>Long ago, the Kingdom of Eslarthia and Ilratheino were at war. A hundred years later, Eslarthia ended the war when they defeated the Ilratheino king in a duel. Ilratheino surrendered, and Eslarthia gained power over the entire continent. Little did Eslarthia know that Ilratheino was prepared for their defeat. <br>

                                                                       *  *  *<br>

In the palace of Eslarthia, the king was throwing a feast for the entire palace. All of the generals, captains, noblemen, and wives were invited.<br>

“Let us celebrate the victory over the kingdom of Ilratheino! We now have control over our entire continent. Let our reign last for generations to come!” The king shouted, raising his glass, and everyone joined in.<br> 

The feast commenced, and everyone was enjoying themselves.<br>

The lords and ladies talked to each other on how their family was of great help to the war. The generals were going over more war strategies, and the royal family was content. Sadly, this happiness couldn’t last long. <br>

Everyone stopped eating and talking because they heard strangled breathing, and gurgling. They looked down the long table to see that the king’s right-hand man was holding his neck, barely breathing. A few seconds later, he died. Medics arrived as fast as they could, and examined him to see how exactly he died. When they were done, the only conclusion they had was that he was poisoned. There was nothing blocking his airway, and he didn’t have any severe allergies, so poison was the only possible solution. <br>

The king ended the feast immediately, and told everyone to be on high alert in case anything like this should happen again. <br>

                                                                       *  *  *<br>

The royal family went to the throne room with his generals to discuss what to do next. They were all still in shock at what happened back at the feast, but were determined to stop whatever was going on. <br>

“The problem is that we don’t have any idea who poisoned General Carlos.” one of the generals said. <br></h3>

    <h1>Eternal Empires</h1>
    
    <h3>Long ago, the Kingdom of Eslarthia and Ilratheino were at war. A hundred years later, Eslarthia ended the war when they defeated the Ilratheino king in a duel. Ilratheino surrendered, and Eslarthia gained power over the entire continent. Little did Eslarthia know that Ilratheino was prepared for their defeat. <br><br>

In the palace of Eslarthia, the king was throwing a feast for the entire palace. All of the generals, captains, noblemen, and wives were invited.“Let us celebrate the victory over the kingdom of Ilratheino! We now have control over our entire continent. Let our reign last for generations to come!” The king shouted, raising his glass, and everyone joined in.<br> 

The feast commenced, and everyone was enjoying themselves.<br><br>

The lords and ladies talked to each other on how their family was of great help to the war. The generals were going over more war strategies, and the royal family was content. Sadly, this happiness couldn’t last long. <br>

Everyone stopped eating and talking because they heard strangled breathing, and gurgling. They looked down the long table to see that the king’s right-hand man was holding his neck, barely breathing. A few seconds later, he died. Medics arrived as fast as they could, and examined him to see how exactly he died. When they were done, the only conclusion they had was that he was poisoned. There was nothing blocking his airway, and he didn’t have any severe allergies, so poison was the only possible solution. <br>

The king ended the feast immediately, and told everyone to be on high alert in case anything like this should happen again. <br>

The royal family went to the throne room with his generals to discuss what to do next. They were all still in shock at what happened back at the feast, but were determined to stop whatever was going on. <br>

“The problem is that we don’t have any idea who poisoned General Carlos.” one of the generals said.<br></h3>
    
    
    <h3>“Very true. We need to get to the bottom of this, no matter what. Olivia, I want you to round up the best scholars in the kingdom and investigate this further.” King Darius commanded. <br><br>

“Of course, father.” Olivia replied.<br><br>

“Captain Adrien and Max, I want you two to round up the guards. Train them as hard as you can so that when Olivia does find out who poisoned General Carlos, the guard will be ready to hunt them down.” 
“Yes, your majesty.” Captain Adrien answered, and Miles, the crowned prince, nodded in agreement. <br><br>

“Donovan, I want you to go and research all you can about the available poisons in the kingdom, that would be greatly appreciated. Also, could you be able to make a few antidotes for those poisons as well? We don’t want another incident to happen.” The king asks his youngest son.<br><br>

“Absolutely.”<br><br>

“Thank you. And Jake, I want you to help me with the political aspect of this matter. We don’t want the kingdom freaking out about this. We need to make sure that the kingdom knows about the danger that this person possesses, but we also need them to not panic about this.”<br><br>

And so, that’s what everyone did. After the meeting was over, the king’s children immediately went to their tasks at hand. Olivia went to the scholars’ wing to see what they could find out about the poison. Captain Adrien and Mileswent to the barracks and trained them from dawn to dusk. Donovan went to his study where he keeps most of his experiments on poisons, and all of those things. He requested that his sister bring him a sample of General Carlos’s blood to see which poison was used on him. And Jake, King Darius, Queen Fiona, and the rest of the Generals worked on how they would present this news to the kingdom.<br><br>

In the dining hall, Princess Olivia and the scholars are examining the body of General Carlos. <br><br>

“Who do you think did this?” Emerson asks us. <br><br>

“Not sure.” Olivia replied. <br><br>

Olivia had chosen a group of six scholars to help you investigate this case. These six scholars are the best in the kingdom, and she happened to be friends with all of them. <br><br>

When she was little, she read all of these mystery books and movies. She loved investigating cases and solving mysteries. She did this so much that she was named the best detective in the entire kingdom. So, whenever her father would need someone to investigate something, Olivia was his go to person.</h3><strong>NEW LINE HERE<strong> 

      <h3> Olivia wasn’t wearing her usual gown and tiara because she’s investigating the death of General Carlos. Instead, she was wearing black leggings, a navy blue shirt, and a pair of combat boots. She has her dark brown hair pulled into a tight bun so it doesn’t fall in front of her face. She’s kneeling beside the body of General Carlos, trying to figure out what type of poison was used. Her brother had told her to give him as much of a description about the body as possible, because it would help him figure out what type of poison was used. 

She examined his face closely, and noticed that his veins were so clear, it looked like his skin was made out of glass. At the corners of his mouth, white froth was evident, and his eyes were bloodshot. She took note of all of this in her notebook, and got up to examine the rest of the room. Her father had ordered that nothing be moved from the dining hall so we could get a better understanding of what happened. 

She had sent a few of the scholars to go down to the cellars and kitchens to see if someone had tampered with the food or drinks. The rest of them were helping her in the dining hall. <br><br>

“Emerson, Parker, Mia, can you three go check to see if any of the other generals’ drinks were tampered with. They probably weren’t, since they’re still alive, but we can’t be too sure.” she says. <br><br>

Olivia walks over to where General Carlos was sitting last night to see what exactly had happened to him. The food couldn’t have been poisoned, since everyone had been taking food off of the giant platters in the center of the table. So, the only possibility was that the poison was in his drink. She picked up his glass, and swirled the wine around. It looked fine to her, but she didn’t want to take the chance to drink it herself. One thing she did notice was that the wine had a bluish tint to it, so she poured a sample of the wine into a glass phial, and shoved the phial into her pocket. She then walked back over to General Carlos’s body and drew a blood sample from him and also placed the sample in a glass phial. She shoved that phial into her pocket as well, then stood up.<br><br>

“Did any of you find anything important?” she asked.<br><br>

“We don’t believe that the other drinks have been tampered with. The food looks fine, and everything else looks normal.” Parker answered.<br><br>

The four of them heard footsteps approaching the dining hall, and they all spun around to see that it was just the rest of the scholars. 

“What did you three find?” Olivia asked them. <br><br>
“Nothing was wrong in the cellars or the kitchens, but we did find this.” a scholar with long, wavy black hair said, handing Olivia a bottle. 
        <br><br>

        “What is this?” NEW LINE HERE</h3>
    
    <h3>“We believe it’s poison. We don’t know who it belongs to though. We saw the bottle resting on the counter.” <br><br>
      
     “Thank you, Emily. I will get this to my brother as soon as possible. Well, thank you all for your time. I think I have enough information for today. If you don’t mind, we’ll start again, same time tomorrow.” Olivia told them, exiting the dining hall.<br><br>

She made her way through the large castle, and up the stairs to her youngest brother’s room. She knocked on the door, and a few seconds later, a voice called for her to enter. <br><br>

“Hey, Donovan. I brought you the samples you asked for.” she says, handing him all three phials and the paper with the description about General Carlos.<br><br>

“I only asked for one. What are the other two?” he asks. <br><br>

“One of them is a blood sample. The other is a wine sample. And the other one Emily gave me. She told me that they found it on the counter in the kitchen. I think it’s poison, but I’m not exactly sure. I’m giving you all three to see if you can figure out if the poison in General Carlos’s blood is the same thing that’s in the other two phials. If so, we need to figure out who poisoned him before he kills anyone else.” Olivia responds. <br><br>

“Thanks, sis. I’ll do my best.”<br><br>

And with that, Olivia returned to her room to change. Since she’s no longer investigating, and that it’s just about dinner time, she has to change back into her usual gown and tiara. She changed into a sky blue gown and heels. Brushed her hair out and curled it slightly. Applied some make-up, and some jewelry. Once she was done, she made her way down to the throne room.

After Olivia left his room, Donovan immediately went to work on examining the phials that she gave her. He looked at the paper that she handed him, and knew the symptoms of the poison immediately. The moonshadow poison is the most deadly poison in the entire continent. It was so rare that the only people to own it are the royal families of both kingdoms. He knew for a fact that the only time his family has ever used the moonshadow poison was because a decade ago, there was a mass murderer and was going insane. That was the only time in the entire history of the Ambrose family ruling Eslarthia had used it. That meant that the Whitlock family poisoned the General. The question was how. 

Just to be safe, Donovan ran a few tests on the samples, and they all returned with the same answer. Moonshadow poison. He locks the results into a drawer in my desk in case that there are spies in the castle, then heads towards the door. Before he's able to get there though, he feels a hand on my shoulder. He slowly turns around to see a person staring back at him with gleaming eyes. Before he can let out a scream in warning, the person lifts his hand to reveal a blade, and stabs it through his heart.  

Donovan drops to the ground, blood pooling around him. NEW LINE HERE</h3>
    
    <h3>Back in the dining hall, the servants have cleaned up the mess from the night before, and the royal family has sat down to eat. The king and queen are sitting at the heads of the table, opposite of each other, with their children on either side of the table. Miles is sitting to Darius’s right with Jake beside him, and on the other side of the table, Olivia is sitting to her mother’s right, and the chair beside her empty.<br><br>

“Olivia, sweety, do you know where your brother is?” Queen Fiona asked. <br><br>

“No, I have no clue. The last time I saw him was when I gave him the results of our search today.” Olivia responded, worried about where her brother could be.<br><br> 

They’ve been waiting for fifteen minutes now, and Donovan still hasn’t shown up yet. He’s never been late before. Usually it’s anyone except Donovan and Queen Fiona that’s late. Sometimes Olivia takes too long to get ready. Miles is usually training and loses track of time. Jake is usually reviewing the events that are happening throughout the kingdom. And Darius is usually held up in meetings most of the time, making him late to dinner. But Donovan being late is very unlikely. 

Worried about her brother, Olivia gets up from the table.<br><br>

“Where are you going?” Darius asked her. <br><br>

“I’m worried about Donovan. He’s never late to dinner. I fear something bad has happened to him.” she replied. <br><br>

The rest of her family followed her out of the dining hall, and they made their way up to Donovan’s study. When they reach his study, the door is slightly ajar. Olivia pushes the door open and screams. Tears are running down her face at the sight. Her brother’s body lay motionless on the ground, surrounded by a pool of blood and a knife in his heart. Not caring about her dress anymore, she kneels beside her brother, entangling her hand in his, crying over his body. 

Queen Fiona sobs as well, kneeling beside her daughter. The remaining princes have mixed emotions spread across their faces. Shock, anger, sadness, grief, and sorrow mixed together. And King Darius, known for always staying strong, no matter what, showing no emotion whatsoever, lets a tear fall down his face. The only sign that people will see that he’s upset about his son's death. Outside, he has to stay strong for his family, but inside he’s broken. He’d never thought that he would live to see the day that one of his children would be stabbed through the heart. He knew that he would do anything in his power to avenge his son, and stop this mad man. 

On shaky legs, Olivia slowly gets up and stands beside her brothers. She has to lean against Miles to keep her upright, or else she will collapse on the floor. Out of all of the siblings, Olivia was definitely the closest with Donovan, and now that he’s gone, she feels empty inside. Miles places his arm around her shoulders in an attempt to comfort her. Tears are still falling down Olivia’s face, unable to stop them. She wipes her face, trying to remove as many tears as possible, and retreats into Miles’s comforting shape. He pulls her closer, wrapping his arms around her in a hug. 

After a long time, the royal family finally leaves his room, and orders the servants to prepare his body for the funeral. The one thing they did do before they left was take the knife out of his chest. The king holds it with a glove, making sure not to get his fingerprints on it.

    <h3>The next morning, a funeral is planned for the death of Donovan Ambrose, the youngest son of King Darius and Queen Fiona. The queen and princess are both dressed in long, black mourning gowns. Their eyes reveal the amount of grief and sadness they have. The king and princes are in their uniforms, with a new patch on their arm, representing Donovan’s personal crest. A black rose surrounded by blue flames. Each member of the royal family has one, and whenever a member of the family dies, the remaining members of the family sew their crest onto their uniform as a sign of respect. 

The royal family says their final goodbyes to Donovan, then he is left to rest with the rest of the deceased Ambrose family. 

Olivia has tears slowly falling down her face, attempting not to break out into full blown tears. The king is trying to stay strong for his family, but you could still tell that he’s still grieving. The princes are about to break, and the queen also has tears down her face. 

The public was also invited to watch the funeral, and they all had a look of mourning on their faces for the loss of one of the princes of Eslarthia. 

When his body is covered up, Olivia and Miles walk over to the tombstone carved with his crest and the Ambrose crest and place a bouquet of flowers next to it. The bouquet was a bouquet of black roses, Donovan’s favorite. Also the reason why that flower is on his crest. Your crest is made up of the flower that you like, and something that represents you. Donovan always loved the black roses in the palace gardens, and the blue fire, which symbolized that he may be the youngest of the family, but he will always burn the brightest. 
The two siblings walk away, Olivia about to break, and Miles about to start crying. 

The public soon files out of the courtyard, and the royal family returns to the palace. 



That night, no one could sleep. Olivia cried all night because of her dead brother. Miles and Jake were scared that they would be next to follow their dead brother, and in the privacy of their own rooms, they too shed tears for their brother. Queen Fiona was a sobbing mess because of her son’s death, and King Darius finally broke.

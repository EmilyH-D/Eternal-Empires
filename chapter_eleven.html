<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>

<p>During the course of the next two weeks, Olivia made huge progress on the investigation. The staff found a page in the kitchens that looked a lot like a hitlist. On the list were all the people that were already killed, along with a few more. While reading it, Olivia was determined to stop the murderer before the others were killed as well. She interrogated all of the kitchen staff, and three people stuck out as possible suspects of the murders. She had the king keep them locked up for the time being, until they found any more evidence that one of them could be the murderer.<br><br>

Jake finally told the kingdom about all of the murders, and thankfully, they didn’t take it the wrong way. With the engagements and everything, they made it look like they had everything under control. <br><br>

One day, Olivia is walking down a hall towards the library when she hears some commotion. She runs as fast as she can in her heels to find General Morgan lying in the middle of the hall, knife in his chest, blood pooling around him. <br><br>

“Oh my god! What happened!” she shouts, running over to him. <br><br>

“Th-the m-murderer said, ‘I’m from Ilra-’” General Morgan whispers, then his eyes glaze over and he’s gone. <br><br>
Olivia replays his last words, and realises what he meant. The murderer is from Ilratheino. <br><br>

“Guard!” she shouts, and they come rushing towards her, shocked at the sight.<br><br>

“Move the body. Take the knife to the scholars and tell them to run tests on the knife. Prepare the body for a burial and gather the members of council immediately. There needs to be a meeting now!” she commands in a voice that sounded so much like her mother when she’s really angry. <br><br>

She’s walking back to her room to get changed, since her dress is covered in blood when she runs into the one person that she really doesn’t want to see right now.<br><br>

“Liv! What happened! Why are you covered in blood?” Emerson shouts, rushing towards her.<br><br>

“Get away from me.” she growls, pushing past him, but he grabs her wrist, spinning her around to face her.<br><br>

“Liv? What happened? Why are you like this?”<br><br>

“Why am I like this!” she screams. “Let’s see! How ‘bout the fact that the murderer that killed my brother is from Ilratheino! You knew about this the entire time and you didn’t even bother to tell me! You just let me think that you had nothing to do with this entire situation but in reality, you are the reason for all of this! I trusted you! You knew who killed my brother, but you stayed quiet! Stay away from me if you know what’s best for you.” she warns, ripping her wrist out of his grapes, and walking away.<br><br>

“I didn’t know about that! I swear!” He calls after her, but it’s too late. She was gone. <br><br>

She quickly changes and heads to the council chambers. <br><br>

“Why have you gathered us here, Olivia?” her father asks her as she walks in. Everyone is looking at her, concerned. <br><br>

“Because the murderer is from Ilratheino.” she says and everyone gasps in shock. <br><br>

“Are you sure about that?”<br><br>

“Positive. General Morgan was just killed, and his last words were “The murderer said ‘I’m from Ilratheino.’” We have the Whitlock family here, and they know who the murderer is. My suggestion is to interrogate them.”<br><br>

“How do you know that they’ll tell us the truth? If they really do know who the murderer is, why would they just tell us that?”<br><br>

“Because I have just the thing that will make them tell us.”<br>

<p>The next day, the entire Whitlock family is tied up to chairs in the dungeons, the Ambrose family glaring daggers at all of them.<br><br>

“Liv, please listen to me. We don’t have any idea who the murderer is.” Emerson begs.<br><br>

“I don’t want to listen to your feeble excuses. Addam, potion please.” Olivia says, and Addam hands her a small glass phial containing a clear water like liquid.<br><br>

“This is something that my late brother gave to me before he died. It makes whoever takes it tell the truth. Five drops of this and I can have you telling me your entire life story.” Olivia explains, scaring Emerson half to death. <br><br>

The scholars pour two drops of the potion into each member of the Whitlock family, glaring daggers at them the entire time. <br><br>

“What do you know about the murderer in our palace?” King Darius commands.<br><br>

“My father told me before he died that he sent someone into your kingdom at the beginning of the war to bring your kingdom to your knees if we ever lost to you in the war. He commanded him to kill General Carlos, General Morgan, General Adrien, Prince Donovan, You, the rest of your children, and the rest of the generals.” King Felix responds, then clamps a mouth over his hand at the information that he just spilled. <br><br>

“Emerson, did you really not know anything about this?” Olivia asks him, voice softer than before.<br><br>

“No. I promise I didn’t know anything about this. If I did, I would’ve told you. I love you too much to do that to you.” Emerson responds sincerely. <br><br>

Olivia is taken aback by his response.<br><br>

    <em>Did he seriously just say that he loved me?</em><br><br>

Not trusting her mouth to speak, she simply nods her thanks, still pondering over what he had just said. <br><br>


At the end of the interrogation, Olivia has a better idea of who the murderer is. She asks her father if she can interrogate the prisoners again, and he gladly complies. The Ambrose family releases the Whitlock family, then exits the dungeons.<br><br>

As she makes her way towards her room, a hand grabs her wrist. She turns around to see Emerson looking at her with a pleading look on his face.<br><br>

“What’s up?” <br><br>

“Are you still mad at me?” he asks her.<br><br>

“Not anymore, now that I know that you had nothing to do with it.” Olivia responds, and Emerson lets out a sigh of relief. <br><br>

“I really did mean what I said back there.”<br><br>

“What do you mean?”<br><br>

“I love you. And I know that it’s weird since we’ve been friends since we were twelve, but I really do love you. You don’t have to love me back at all or anything, and I know that it’s really weird timing at that, given the whole murderer thing going on, bu-”<br><br>

Olivia interrupts his ranting by kissing him. <br><br>

“I love you too. And by the way, you talk too much.” She tells him, pulling away.<br>

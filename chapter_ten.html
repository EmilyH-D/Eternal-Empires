<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>

<p>The next day, Olivia returned to her investigation duties, and Miles returned to training the guards. <br><br>

Olivia wore her usual black outfit, and met up with the scholars.<br><br>

“Did you guys find anything?” she asks them.<br><br>

“Yes. After investigation, we found out that the knife that killed your brother was from the kitchens. We studied the knife, and found out that it was coated in moonshadow poison. After careful inspection of the blood sample from General Carlos, General Adrien, and the knife, we found out that it was the same batch of poison in each person. That means that this person has a giant tub of this poison lying around and is storing it somewhere in the palace. I would like you to ask your father if we can have a full inspection of the kitchens, and interrogate every staff member in the kitchens. We need to get to the bottom of this before anyone else gets hurt.” Mia explains. <br><br>

“Of course. I will tell my father the second after we finish today. Is there anything else that I need to know, or can we take a look around the kitchen now, before we get experts in there?”<br><br>

“Let’s head inside.”<br><br>

The six scholars and Olivia headed down to the kitchens to see what they could find. Sadly, they couldn’t find anything without violating rules that her father put in place.The only way that they could find out more was if he let them. Which Olivia was planning to talk to him about as soon as possible. <br><br>

After they were done for the day, Olivia immediately headed for her father’s study. She knocked on the door and waited until her father let her in.<br><br>

“What can I help you with?” he asks her.<br><br>

“I wish to ask you for permission to have a thorough investigation of the kitchens, and for a proper interrogation of all of the kitchen staff. The scholars have found out that the knife that killed Donovan came from the kitchens. They also found a bottle of moonshadow poison there when General Carlos was killed. I also wish to look through the records for the poison, to see exactly what was done with it in the last three months, to see who would have it in our kingdom.”<br><br>

“Very well. I’ll tell the search team to investigate the kitchens and the houses of all of the kitchen staff. You may interrogate them at 3:00pm tomorrow. I will make sure that they are all there.”<br><br>

“Thank you, father.” she says, exiting the room. <br><br>

Letting her team rest for the day, Olivia searches for Scarlet, knowing that she wouldn’t be hanging out with Miles since he’s training all day.<br><br>

“Hey, Scarlet.”<br><br>

“Oh, hey Olivia. By the way, there’s no reason for you to call me Scarlet all the time. Call me Scar if you want.”<br><br>

“Very well, Scar. You can call me Liv as well, if you want.”

“Sure thing”<br><br>

“Want to hang out?”<br><br>

“Sure. What do you have in mind?”<br><br>

“I don’t know. All I know is that I need to get away from boys for a little while.”<br><br>

“Me too.” Scarlet chuckles. <br><br>

The two of them end up going to Olivia’s salon, doing each other’s make-up and nails. <br><br>

“You know, I’ve never had anyone to do this with. Usually my maids do this, and that isn’t much fun.” Olivia says.<br><br>

“Same here. Not the whole maid thing, but it’s boring doing this by yourself. I’m glad that you’re doing this with me. And it’s good to get away from the boys for a while.” Scarlet responds. <br><br>


“True.”<br><br>

“So, I have to ask. I know that you and Emerson are engaged and all, but Miles told me that it was an arranged marriage. Do you actually love him?”<br><br>

“Honestly, I’m not sure. Our fathers have been friends for a long time, even while the war was going on. He was my first friend, mainly because our fathers would always make us hang out together. We both knew since we were fifteen that we would have to marry each other some day, but at the time, we didn’t really want that. I wanted to actually find love, and Emerson was tired of being controlled by his parents all of the time, and the news didn’t help with that. I feel like after a little while, he eventually got used to the fact that we would have to marry each other, but didn’t realise that it would be so soon. Thank my brother Jake for making that happen. I feel like I could get to love him through marriage, but I’m not sure. It’s only been two days since we got engaged. Before that, we were simply friends. It’s not like things are going to drastically change in two days. But who knows, right?”<br><br>

“I guess.”<br><br>

“Why do you ask?”<br><br>

“I just figured since you were so close, that you at least felt something towards him.”<br><br>


“Can we talk about something else?”<br><br>

“Like what?”<br><br>

“I don’t know. How ‘bout when I saw you kissing my brother the day of the ball.”<br><br>

“Y-you saw that?” she stammers, blushing.<br><br>

“Yup.”<br>

The rest of the day was the two of them talking and enjoying each other’s company. <br><br>

Once Scarlet left, Olivia pondered about what Scarlet had told her. <br><br>

<em>Did she really feel something more towards Emerson? She shook her head. No, no. I can’t. He’s my best friend. That would be weird. Then again, they were engaged, so how much weirder can things get?</em><br><br>

The entire night she thought about that one question. Did she feel anything more towards Emerson, other than being friends? At some point during the night, she realised that she did. She always knew that she felt something more towards him, but she made herself think that it was only because he’s her best friend. Now, there was no way that she could deny it. She’d inadvertently fallen for her best friend. She mentally cursed herself for that, but realised that he could possibly feel the same. Then her mind started spinning about whether he felt the same or not. She eventually realised that it was a lost cause to try to figure it out at 2 o’clock in the morning, and just decided to get some sleep.
